The experiment was carried out to evaluate the effect of saline stress on $\alpha$-amylase activity and starch, sugar reducers, total soluble carbohydrates and protein contents. The $\alpha$-amylase activity and the contents of total soluble carbohydrates, sugar reducers and proteins decreased but starch content increased with the increase in salinity for both cultivars. At all NaCl concentrations, the chemical components in the seeds of the BRS 179 cultivar were higher than the ones of the BRS 177 cultivar, showing that the BRS 179 cultivar is more tolerant to salinity.},

abstract = {Yield comparison and stability evaluation of genotypes based on multi-environment trials (MET) play an important role in crop breeding and varietal recommendation for crop production. Usually, analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used for yield comparison, whereas other models (e.g. Shukla's and multiplicative models) are used for stability evaluation. This analysis methodology has the weakness that on the one hand the variance heterogeneity of genotypes (i.e. stability) cannot be accounted for in yield comparison, and on the other hand assumptions about variance–covariance of genotype effects stability evaluation are not identical to that in yield comparison though the trial and hence the data are the same. Furthermore, the eventual error variation due to different levels of trial precision across different environments cannot be accounted for in both yield comparison and stability evaluation. In this paper, the mixed model with various variance–covariance structures allowing for accounting for variance heterogeneity of both genotype and residual error effects was used to fit the seed yield data from a (Brassica napus L.) MET with thirteen rape genotypes (QS101–QS113) and randomized complete block design at each test environment for the upper reaches of the Yangtze River of China. The variance components of the best fitting mixed model served as measures of stability, and yield comparisons of genotypes were made also on the basis of the best fitting model. The result showed that the variance–covariance characteristics of both genotypes and residual errors affected stability evaluation of rape genotypes. Appropriately incorporating this information in estimating and statistical testing of genotype effects based on mixed model methodology was important for yield comparison of rape genotypes; Compared to the check (QS108), QS113 highly significantly ($\alpha$=0.01) increased yield by 10{\%} with high stability; QS109 highly significantly and QS104 significantly ($\alpha$=0.05) increased yield, respectively, by 10.4{\%} and 6.2{\%}, respectively, with low stability; QS102, QS101, QS110 and QS105 were superior only in term of stability; the other six genotypes were inferior in term of both significant yield difference and stability.},

When sample size was small, the imprecision of the diagnostic criteria estimates interfered with multicollinearity diagnosis in the matrix with weak multicollinearity.},

abstract = {LEA proteins are late embryogenesis abundant in the seeds of many higher plants and are probably universal in occurrence in plant seeds. LEA mRNAs and proteins can be induced to appear at other stages in the plant's life by desiccation stress and/or treatment with the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA). A role in protecting plant structures during water loss is likely for these proteins, with ABA functioning in the stress transduction process. Presented here are conserved tracts of amino acid sequence among LEA proteins from several species that may represent domains functionally important in desiccation protection. Curiously, an 11 amino acid sequence motif is found tandemly repeated in a group of LEA proteins of vastly different sizes. Analysis of this motif suggests that it exists as an amphiphilic $\alpha$ helix which may serve as the basis for higher order structure.},

abstract = {Maize ( L.) plants were grown in the field and labelled with CO at four leaf positions from silking up to maturity. The ear leaf was the most important source of labelled photosynthates to the ear, followed by the first leaf blade above and below the ear. The movement of labelled assimilates from the second leaf blade below the ear was predominantly downwards. The ear became an important sink soon after silking and continued in importance till harvest. Initially assimilates were partitioned within the ear as husk {\{}{\textless}{\}} cob {\{}{\textless}{\}} grains but at harvest as grains {\{}{\textless}{\}} cob {\{}{\textless}{\}} husk. There was considerable remobilization of assimilates from the husk and stem. Removal of leaves drastically altered the pattern of distribution of labelled photosynthates and the direction of movement was determined by the position of the source leaf blade and the defoliation treatment. Darkening the leaf blades did not much alter the translocation of the labelled photosynthate and increased slightly its proportion to the grains. The removal of the ear severely altered the pattern of distribution of C, which was mostly deposited in the stem.},

Breeding lines capable of fixing enough atmospheric N2 to support seed yields of 1000–2000 kg ha−1 have been identified and new cultivars with high N2 fixation potential are being released.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT The sensitivity of wheat crop to environmental variations frequently results in significant genotype (G) x environment (E) interaction (GEI). We compared statistical methods to analyze adaptability and stability of wheat genotypes in value for cultivation and use (VCU) trials. We used yield performance data of 22 wheat genotypes evaluated in three locations (Guarapuava, Cascavel, and Abelardo Luz) in 2012 and 2013. Each trial consisted of a complete randomized block design with three replications. The GEI was evaluated using methodologies based on mixed models, analysis of variance, linear regression, multivariate, and nonparametric analysis. The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to verify similarities in the genotype selection process by different methodologies. The Annicchiarico, Lin and Binns modified methodologies, as well as the Harmonic Mean of the Genetic Values (HMGV) allowed to identify simultaneously highly stable and productive genotypes. The grain yield is not associated with Wricke, Eberhart and Russell stability parameters, scores of the first principal component of the AMMI1 method, and GGE biplot stability, indicating that stable genotypes are not always more productive. The data analyzed in this study showed that the AMMI1 and GGE biplot methods are equivalent to rank genotypes for stability and adaptability.},

abstract = {Jasmonic acid (JA) is regarded as endogenous regulator that plays an important role in regulating stress responses, plant growth and development. To investigate the physiological mechanisms of salt stress mitigated by exogenous JA, foliar application of 2 mM JA was done to wheat seedlings for 3 days and then they were subjected to 150 mM NaCl. Our results showed that 150 mM NaCl treatment significantly decreased plant height, root length, shoot dry weight, root dry weight, the concentration of glutathione (GSH), chlorophyll b (Chl b) and carotenoid (Car), the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), enhanced the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and the rate of superoxide radical ( O 2 − ) generation in the wheat seedlings when compared with the control. However, treatments with exogenous JA for 3 days significantly enhanced salt stress tolerance in wheat seedlings by decreasing the concentration of MDA and H2O2, the production rate of O 2 − and increasing the transcript levels and activities of SOD, POD, CAT and APX and the contents of GSH, Chl b and Car, which, in turn, enhanced the growth of salt stressed seedlings. These results suggested that JA could effectively protect wheat seedlings from salt stress damage by enhancing activities of antioxidant enzymes and the concentration of antioxidative compounds to quench the excessive reactive oxygen species caused by salt stress and presented a practical implication for wheat cultivation in salt-affected soils.},

abstract = {Relationships between peak annual vascular aboveground phytomass and annual climate variation in alpine plant communities located on Niwot Ridge, Colorado, were analyzed using path analysis. The five community types, fellfield, dry meadow, moist meadow, wet meadow, and snowbed, represent a snow depth—soil moisture gradient and broadly represent the most common vegetation types on east—facing slopes of the Front Range alpine zone. Using nine successive years of data, this is the first longer term analysis of alpine phytomass and climate and one of the longest nonagricultural production records available. Live phytomass ranged from 97 g/m2 (snowbed) to 237 g/m2 (fellfield). Among—community differences in phytomass were greater than differences among years, but there was also significant phytomass variation among years. Path analysis indicated that climate accounted for 15—40{\%} of the variation in phytomass. The dry communities, fellfield (exposed rocky summit areas dominated by cushion and mat plants) and dry meadow, were most sensitive to previous year precipitation, the moist and wet meadow communities were most sensitive to current growth season soil moisture, and the snowbed community was most sensitive to date of snow release. Because of the relatively high amount of variation attributable to variables related to precipitation, changes in precipitation regimes that may occur in alpine ecosystems will likely result in changes in phytomass that are detectable with clip—harvest methods.

We aimed to determine the prevalence of fruit and vegetable consumption and associated sociodemographic and behavioral factors among {\{}CKs{\}} customers. A cross-sectional study enrolling customers of 48 {\{}CKs{\}} in two areas of Lima, Peru, was performed. The self-reported amount of fruits and vegetables consumed ({\textless} 5 vs. ≥ 5 servings/day) was the outcome. The exposures were grouped in sociodemographic variables (i.e. age, gender, education level, etc.), and self-reported intention to change eating- and exercise-related habits in the last four weeks just prior to the interview. Prevalence ratios (PR) were estimated using Poisson regression. Data from 422 subjects were analyzed, 328 females (77.9{\%}), mean age 43.7 (± 14.5) years. Only 36 (8.5{\%}; 95{\%} {\{}CI{\}} 5.9{\%}–11.2{\%}) customers reported consuming ≥ 5 servings of fruits and vegetables daily. This pattern was 4-fold more likely among those with higher levels of education (≥ 12 vs. {\textless} 7 years), and 64{\%} less common for migrants relative to non-migrants. In terms of intentions to change habits, those who reported having tried to reduce sugar consumption or to eat more fruits were up to 90{\%} more likely to meet the ≥ 5 servings/day target. A substantial gap in the consumption of ≥ 5 servings of fruits and vegetables/day was found among {\{}CKs{\}} customers that does not appear to be dependent on familial income. The profiles reported in this study can inform appropriate strategies to increase healthier eating in this population. },

The phylogeny was constructed using bioinfomatics tools. A total of 243 gene sequences for 30 plant species were found.

abstract = {Legumes produce a high diversity of secondary metabolites which serve as defence compounds against herbivores and microbes, but also as signal compounds to attract pollinating and fruit-dispersing animals. As nitrogen-fixing organisms, legumes produce more nitrogen containing secondary metabolites than other plant families. Compounds with nitrogen include alkaloids and amines (quinolizidine, pyrrolizidine, indolizidine, piperidine, pyridine, pyrrolidine, simple indole, Erythrina, simple isoquinoline, and imidazole alkaloids; polyamines, phenylethylamine, tyramine, and tryptamine derivatives), non-protein amino acids (NPAA), cyanogenic glucosides, and peptides (lectins, trypsin inhibitors, antimicrobial peptides, cyclotides). Secondary metabolites without nitrogen are phenolics (phenylpropanoids, flavonoids, isoflavones, catechins, anthocyanins, tannins, lignans, coumarins and furanocoumarins), polyketides (anthraquinones), and terpenoids (especially triterpenoid, steroidal saponins, tetraterpenes). While some secondary metabolites have a wide distribution (flavonoids, triterpenes, pinitol), however, others occur in a limited number of taxa. The distributions of secondary metabolites with an irregular occurrence are mapped on a molecular phylogeny of the Fabaceae, reconstructed from a combined data set of nucleotide sequences from rbcL, matK and ITS genes. In most cases, the distribution patterns of secondary metabolites do not agree with the phylogeny of the plants producing them. In contrary, the distribution of many secondary metabolites is patchy and irregular. Thus, the use of phytochemical data to reconstruct a phylogeny of plants is often not informative and can be misleading. The patchy distribution may be due to convergent evolution, a contribution of endophytic fungi or more likely, to an early acquisition of the key genes of secondary metabolism in the evolution of land plants among others by horizontal gene transfer from bacteria. Thus it would be a matter of gene regulation whether these genes are active in some but not all taxa.},

Nonnormal data such as counts or proportions often defy classical statistical procedures. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) provide a more flexible approach for analyzing nonnormal data when random effects are present. The explosion of research on GLMMs in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult. We review the use (and misuse) of GLMMs in ecology and evolution, discuss estimation and inference and summarize ‘best-practice' data analysis procedures for scientists facing this challenge.},

abstract = {Fructans are polymers that are widely used in several industrial applications. In the last few years they have received increasing interest because of their positive effects on health. At present, fructans are mostly supplied by chicory, which is only grown and processed in The Netherlands, France, and Belgium. It would therefore be an attractive concept to expand its cultivation to the southern European countries, although water shortage and high temperatures may hinder its growth and yield. So far, few experiments have been carried out on the effects of water, so the present research was focused on the course of growth and fructan quality in rainfed (W0) and well-watered (W1) conditions. The positive effects of water restoration mostly concerned the above-ground dry weight (ADW), whereas the root dry weight (RDW) was less influenced. No significant differences on RDW were found in 1999, whereas it was 14{\%} higher (P {\{}{\textless}{\}}0.01) in W1 in 2000. The effect of water was very clear on assimilate allocation: the overall priority at the whole plant scale seemed to be root structures, then storage reserves, and finally ADW. Therefore, the fructan content was higher in W0, and insignificant differences between W0 and W1 were found on fructan yield at the final harvests. The only significant effect of the water regime on fructans was to speed up their storage. The leaf photosynthetic capacity (A) was poorly affected by water availability, whereas it appeared consistently modulated by leaf temperature and leaf nitrogen content. Stomatal conductance appeared to be mostly affected by the soil water content and it was mostly related to A up to about 300 mmol m−2 s−1. The fructan chain length (DP) was not affected by water regime. Besides, DP classes showed a normal statistical distribution; skewness and kurtosis significantly changed only when the harvest was very late. Equally, a very late harvest time significantly lowered DP.},

abstract = {As a dedicated bioenergy crop, switchgrass is a potential feedstock within the United States for biofuels production. It can be converted to energy dense bio-oil through fast pyrolysis. Biomass compositional differences can influence the conversion efficiency and bio-oil product yield and quality. In order to understand how improvements in bio-oil quality can be achieved by manipulation of biomass composition, differences in switchgrass biomass composition were evaluated for their impacts on fast pyrolysis product yield. Nine genotypes of switchgrass were grown on one prime and two marginal sites in New Jersey. The results show that biomass composition was affected by genotype, the environment, and genotype × environment interactions. Non-catalytic pyrolysis product yields were largely affected by genotypic differences. The most significant impacts on non-catalytic pyrolysis products were from cellulose content and K content in the biomass. It was found that non-methoxylated phenolics were mainly produced from the breakdown of levoglucosan in the presence of K. Mineral content in the biomass was highly variable by environment and soil variability across the sites examined. These differences in mineral content largely impacted product distribution of HZSM-5-catalyzed pyrolysis, showing that lower mineral uptake in the biomass was beneficial for the production of aromatic hydrocarbons. Significant genotypic and environmental effects among the pyrolysis products demonstrate that breeding for improvements in pyrolysis product yield is conceivable but that growing conditions and soil conditions must also be taken into consideration.},

abstract = {Exploring and exploiting variety by environment (V × E) interaction is one of the major challenges facing plant breeders. In paper I of this series, we presented an approach to modelling V × E interaction in the analysis of complex multi-environment trials using factor analytic models. In this paper, we develop a range of statistical tools which explore V × E interaction in this context. These tools include graphical displays such as heat-maps of genetic correlation matrices as well as so-called E-scaled uniplots that are a more informative alternative to the classical biplot for large plant breeding multi-environment trials. We also present a new approach to prediction for multi-environment trials that include pedigree information. This approach allows meaningful selection indices to be formed either for potential new varieties or potential parents.},

In that respect, a particular focus is placed on hemicelluloses from different wood species gained from an industrially feasible upgrading step in the production of dissolving pulps from paper pulps. During alkaline post-extractions for hemicellulose removal, residual lignins are extracted as well. They are either covalently linked to the extracted hardwood xylans or simply co-dissolved in the alkaline lye. In order to better describe the lignin in xylan containing lyes, a method for lignin profiling was set up by hyphenating size-exclusion chromatography of xylans with UV detection which facilitates visualization of the residual lignin distribution. Simultaneous lignin quantification was achieved with lignin standards prepared from Kraft cooking liquors. The setup presented may serve as advanced characterization for novel xylan products.},

abstract = {The aleurone layer (AL) is the grain peripheral tissue; it is rich in micronutrients, vitamins, antioxidants, and essential amino acids. This highly nutritive part of the grain has been less studied partly because its isolation is so laborious. In the present study, the ALs of Triticum aestivum (variety R{\'{e}}cital) were separated manually at 15 stages of grain development. A total of 327 proteins were identified using 2-DE LC-MS/MS. They were classified in six main groups and 26 sub-groups according to their biochemical function. Proteomic analysis revealed seven different profiles distributed among three main development stages: (i) early AL development, with proteins involved in intense metabolic activities in the growth and development of the cell wall compounds; (ii) the intermediate stage, characterized by oxidative stress and defense proteins (65{\%}) linked with loss of water in peripheral layers during grain filling; and (iii) AL maturation, involving the production of amino acids and the control of reactive oxidative species to enable the accumulation and maturation of globulins within the AL. The present study provides the first insights into developing proteome in the AL. We describe the numerous AL enzymes involved in the accumulation of storage protein and in the protection of the endosperm over time.
Biological significance
The hand dissection of wheat aleurone layer (AL) was carried in this study for the first time on fifteen developmental stages from cell differentiation to grain maturity. Three major phases were revealed over AL development: cell division activities, globulins storage, and grain protection. Enzymes related to metabolites and vitamins were abundantly expressed during the two first phases. In parallel to the progressive globulins accumulation, the final phase was characterized by key enzyme synthesis involved in energy production, amino-acids and antioxidant synthesis plus others to face hypoxia and dehydration of grain tissues.},

abstract = {Polyploidy has played a major role in higher plant evolution. Most flowering plants are polyploid, and many are distinct in combining the diploid nuclear genomes from two or more different ancestral species or genera (allopolyploids). Recently, molecular techniques have offered powerful new tools for studying the origin and evolution of polyploids. Genomic in situ hybridization allows unequivocal identification of allopolyploids and visualization of their ancestral genomes. Studies of restriction fragment length polymorphism have shown that maize — hitherto generally viewed as a diploid — is really a tetraploid, and that multiple origins are common, if not the rule, for polyploid plant species. It appears that after polyploid formation, considerable and sometimes very rapid changes in genome structure and gene expression have occurred.},

@article{yan_heritability-adjusted_2009-1,
abstract = {Test environment evaluation has become an increasingly important issue in plant breeding. In the context of indirect selection, a test environment can be characterized by two parameters: the heritability in the test environment and its genetic correlation with the target environment. In the context of GGE biplot analysis, a test environment is similarly characterized by two parameters: its discrimination power and its similarity with other environments. This paper investigates the relationships between GGE biplots based on different data scaling methods and the theory of indirect selection, and introduces a heritability-adjusted (HA) GGE biplot. We demonstrate that the vector length of an environment in the HA-GGE biplot approximates the square root heritability (√H {\{}$\backslash$textbackslash{\}}sqrt H ) within the environment and that the cosine of the angle between the vectors of two environments approximates the genetic correlation (r) between them. Moreover, projections of vectors of test environments onto that of a target environment approximate values of r√H r{\{}$\backslash$textbackslash{\}}sqrt H , which are proportional to the predicted genetic gain expected in the target environment from indirect selection in the test environments at a constant selection intensity. Thus, the HA-GGE biplot graphically displays the relative utility of environments in terms of selection response. Therefore, the HA-GGE biplot is the preferred GGE biplot for test environment evaluation. It is also the appropriate GGE biplot for genotype evaluation because it weights information from the different environments proportional to their within-environment square root heritability. Approximation of the HA-GGE biplot by other types of GGE biplots was discussed.},

@article{Charrad2014,
abstract = {Clustering is the partitioning of a set of objects into groups (clusters) so that objects within a group are more similar to each others than objects in different groups. Most of the clustering algorithms depend on some assumptions in order to define the subgroups present in a data set. As a consequence, the resulting clustering scheme requires some sort of evaluation as regards its validity.
The evaluation procedure has to tackle difficult problems such as the quality of clusters, the degree with which a clustering scheme fits a specific data set and the optimal number of clusters in a partitioning. In the literature, a wide variety of indices have been proposed to find the optimal number of clusters in a partitioning of a data set during the clustering process. However, for most of indices proposed in the literature, programs are unavailable to test these indices and compare them.
The R package NbClust has been developed for that purpose. It provides 30 indices which determine the number of clusters in a data set and it offers also the best clustering scheme from different results to the user. In addition, it provides a function to perform k-means and hierarchical clustering with different distance measures and aggregation methods. Any combination of validation indices and clustering methods can be requested in a single function call. This enables the user to simultaneously evaluate several clustering schemes while varying the number of clusters, to help determining the most appropriate number of clusters for the data set of interest.},

The so-called secondary metabolites, which are a characteristic feature of plants, are especially important and can protect plants against a wide variety of microorganisms (viruses, bacteria, fungi) and herbivores (arthropods, vertebrates). As is the situation with all defense systems of plants and animals, a few specialized pathogens have evolved in plants and have overcome the chemical defense barrier. Furthermore, they are often attracted by a given plant toxin. During domestication of our crop and food plants secondary metabolites have sometimes been eliminated. Taking lupins as an example, it is illustrated that quinolizidine alkaloids are important as chemical defense compounds and that the alkaloid-free varieties (“sweet lupins”), which have been selected by plant breeders, are highly susceptible to a wide range of herbivores to which the alkaloid-rich wild types were resistant. The potential of secondary metabolites for plant breeding and agriculture is discussed.},

Local collinearity in weighted explanatory variables leads to GWR coefficient estimates that are correlated locally and across space, have inflated variances, and are at times counterintuitive and contradictory in sign to the global regression estimates. The presence of local collinearity in the absence of global collinearity necessitates the use of diagnostic tools in the local regression model building process to highlight areas in which the results are not reliable for statistical inference. The method of ridge regression can also be integrated into the GWR framework to constrain and stabilize regression coefficients and lower prediction error. This paper presents numerous diagnostic tools and ridge regression in GWR and demonstrates the utility of these techniques with an example using the Columbus crime dataset.},

abstract = {The primary aim of soil conservation is maintenance of fertility, for which control of erosion is one necessary condition, but soil physical conditions and nutrient status are equally important. Agroforestry refers to land use practices in which trees or shrubs are grown in spatial or temporal association with crops or pastures, and in which there are both ecological and economic interactions between the tree and non-tree components. It is a practicable management option for small farmers and a relatively inexpensive form of land development. In erosion control, agroforestry can contribute both to the barrier and the cover approaches. Agroforestry practices can be employed in erosion control either alone or in conjunction with earth structures. Trees improve soil fertility by maintenance of organic matter, nitrogen fixation, uptake and recycling of nutrients, and other processes. There is a great deal of evidence, in part qualitative or indirect, that agroforestry can contribute substantially to maintenance of soil fertility. Research specifically directed towards agroforestry is recent, hence there are few experimental results to date. The high apparent potential for soil conservation through agroforestry, coupled with the scarcity of experimental data, indicates a clear need for research.},

abstract = {Despite its numerous important traits for biodiesel production, little research exists on the Jatropha curcas crop, mainly with respect to repeated measures over time (crop years). The present study was thus developed to evaluate repeated measures over time in Jatropha curcas and examine the applicability and efficiency of the harmonic mean of the relative performance of genetic values (HMRPGV) method in the selection of families for yield, stability, and adaptability, simultaneously. The work involved data from the evaluation of 730 individuals of 73 half-sib families, in a complete randomized block design, during six crop years, for the trait grain yield. Restricted maximum likelihood/best linear unbiased prediction (REML/BLUP) procedure was performed to estimate the variance components and predict the genetic values. Ten crop years must be evaluated to obtain 80{\%} of the maximum coefficient of determination and 90{\%} accuracy in terms of genetic gain from selection. The efficiency of performing 10 measurements compared with the situation in which only one measurement is used was 67{\%}. The HMRPGV method has great potential in the selection of Jatropha curcas families for yield, stability, and adaptability, simultaneously.},

abstract = {Summary The effects of concentration and source (NH4, NO3, and NO3 plus NH4) of added N on the rate of growth, final yield, and content and rate of intake of N, P, K, Ca, Mg and S by wheat seedlings were evaluated. Rate of growth in dilute liquid cultures differed among the N sources giving yields relative to those of the all-NO3 system of 92 per cent for the all-NH4 system, and of 154 per cent for the NO3 plus NH4 system. At low rates of NH4 intake in the all-NH4 systems growth rates were equal to or slightly better than those of plants supplied equivalent concentrations of NO3. Rates of NH4 intake exceeding 100 $\mu$mole g−1 h−1 resulted in reduced growth rates and incipient NH4 toxicity. Yields at 95 per cent of maximum resulted with steady-state N concentrations of 80 $\mu$M in all NO3 systems, 30 $\mu$M NH4 in all-NH4 systems, and in combined source systems when 200$\mu$M NO3 plus 30 $\mu$M NH4 were supplied. The rate of N intake and plant protein content, were maximal when both NO3 and NH4 were supplied. Increasing rates of NO3 intake were associated with increases in the rates of Ca, Mg, and K intake; but with increasing rates of NH4 absorption, intake of Ca and Mg decreased. The yield and growth rate enhancement observed from the addition of low concentrations of NH4 to cultures supplying adequate NO3 is suggested to result from the reduced energy requirement for utilization of NH4, as compared to NO3 in protein synthesis and from the increased photosynthetic capacity of the higher-protein NH4-fed plants. In the all-NH4 systems the maximum attainable growth rate was limited by NH4 toxicity; whereas in the all-NO3 systems the rate of NO3 reduction was limiting.},

abstract = {Insect reproduction can be stimulated by exposure to sublethal doses of insecticide that kill the same insects at high doses. This bi-phasic dose response to a stressor is known as hormesis and has been demonstrated with many different insect–insecticide models. The specific mechanisms of the increased reproduction in insects following sublethal pesticide exposure are unknown, but may be related to juvenile hormone (JH), which has a major role in regulation of metamorphosis and reproductive development in insects. We tested the hypothesis that exposure to sublethal concentrations of precocene, an antagonist of JH, would not result in stimulated reproductive outputs in the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae, as can be demonstrated with many neurotoxic insecticides. We also measured JH titers and the expression of various developmental (FPPS I), stress response (Hsp60), and dispersal (OSD, TOL and ANT) genes in aphids following exposure to the same precocene treatments. We found that when aphid nymphs were treated with certain sublethal concentrations of precocene, 1.5- to 2-fold increased reproductive stimulation occurred when they became adults, but this effect subsided in the following generation. Precocene treatments to nymphs resulted in no measurable effects on JH levels in subsequent reproducing adults. Although we detected major effects on gene expression following some precocene treatments (e.g. 100- to 300-fold increased expression of some genes), there were no clear relationships between gene expression and reproductive responses for a given treatment.},

abstract = {Pinus pinaster is of great ecological and economic importance and has traditionally been subjected to intensive uses such as wood and resin extraction. In the last decade, dendrochronological methods are increasingly being used to analyze the effects of climatic factors on the growth of the maritime pine, although tapped trees were generally avoided because it was thought that their growth was affected by resin extraction. In Spain, however, it is hard to find a long-lived forest of P. pinaster that has not been subjected to tapping for resin. In the present paper, we performed dendrochronological analyses of this species from wood cores and cross sections taken from both resin-tapped trees and resin-untapped trees killed by a fire in 2008 in the central Iberian region. On the one hand, we reconstructed the history of forest management by means of analysis of resin scars in the cross sections of resin-tapped trees. This facet of dendrochronological dating had not heretofore been developed, and little is therefore known about it. We dated 46 scars, which indicate a history of intensive resin extraction in the 1920–1950 period. Moreover, we attempted to answer the question: Have the old resin extractions in P. pinaster precluded the use of their growth rings for dendrochronological and dendroclimatic studies? We found that resin extraction did not alter general short-wavelength variability, and we developed a local chronology with all synchronized series, and the response function with respect to climate is similar to other oldest P. pinaster forests studied in Spain. The information we have recorded can be of use for providing tools to land managers for interpreting forest dynamics in resin-tapped regions.},

The specific parameters studied were: the variance of a genotype across environments (T1); the genotype x environment (GE) interaction effect for a genotype, squared and summed across all environments (T2); the residual mean square (MS) of deviations from the regression of a genotype on an environmental index (T3); and years within locations MS for a genotype, averaged over all locations (T4). Each stability statistic was fitted to the additive model, based on the assumption that if the stability parameter is heritable, stability of F1 is most likely to be the average stability of its parents. The results showed that T1 and T4 were additive, but T2 and T3 were not. A study of the consistency of stability rankings between two seeding rates over the same set of environments showed a similar pattern. It appears that stability parameters of types 1 and 4 are heritable, and thus useful for selection, while those of types 2 and 3 are nonheritable, and thus not useful.},

abstract = {The Do{\~{n}}ana area in Southwestern Spain has the largest concentration of strawberry producers in Europe. The annual yield, close to 300,000 t, is mainly devoted to the international markets (more than 90{\%}). Due to the high water demand of strawberries and to the environmental concerns of the destination countries, the maximization of water use efficiency is critical for the strawberry sector.

Aiming at the efficient water use in the strawberry production, a comprehensive drip irrigation system has been designed, according to precision irrigation principles. The system has been developed based on a three stages methodology. First, the irrigation process carried out by farmers has been assessed to identify inefficiencies in the irrigation system and management. Their performances have been evaluated using indicators such as the Relative Irrigation Supply (RIS), Strawberry Irrigation Water Applied (SWA) and Strawberry Water Footprint Applied (SWFA). The second phase is focused in an accurate irrigation scheduling based in precise crop water requirements estimation and the optimum irrigation pulse design. Finally, the irrigation system has been designed with the prevailing wisdom of meets the needs of the crop in a timely manner and as efficiently and as spatially uniformly as possible. The most appropriate drip irrigation emitters for the particular conditions of the strawberry production in the study area have been selected. The rest of the on-farm irrigation technologies required to control the system have been integrated, including soil water sensors, smart water meters, programmers, electrovalves and weather station. This precision irrigation system has been installed in a commercial strawberry farm during the irrigation season 2013–2014.

Also, an application for PC, mobiles and tablets has been developed to provide farmers practical information (e.g. irrigation times) for optimal irrigation scheduling.},

A total of 22 genotypes were evaluated in 27 environments in the 2012/2013 crop season and in 19 environments in 2013/2014. In the next crop seasons, 28 genotypes were evaluated in 26 environments, in 2014/2015, and in 25 environments in 2015/2016, totalizing 97 trials. Fourteen methods were evaluated; Spearman correlation coefficients were obtained for the parameters of stability, adaptability, and productivity; and the repeatability coefficients, as well as the minimum number of required environments for a coefficient of determination of 80 and 90{\%}, were calculated. The minimum number of environments required to estimate the degree of association between the parameters was low (seven sites). The methods of Eberhart {\&} Russell and GGE biplot are essential in the evaluation of productivity, adaptability, and stability in soybean because they are able to encompass these aspects using a minimum set of methods. The methods of Annicchiarico (AN), Silva {\&} Barreto (SB), Cruz (CR), and Storck {\&} Vencovsky (SV) can be used to generate complementary information, such as: stability for general, favorable, and unfavorable environments (AN); adaptability in favorable and unfavorable environments (SB, CR, and SV); and average productivity in all environments and in favorable or unfavorable environments (SV).},

The aim of the study was to determine growth, root morphology, SPAD index, chlorophyll fluorescence, leaf mineral composition, and metabolic profiling of greenhouse lettuce either untreated or treated (root or leaf-root application) with a plant-derived protein hydrolysate. For foliar application, plants were sprayed with a solution containing 2.5 ml L−1 of biostimulant, whereas for root application, 100 mL of solution with the same concentration was applied to the growing medium at weekly intervals. Lettuce plants were supplied with two nutrient solutions: non-salt control (1 mM NaCl) or 25 mM NaCl. Salt stress decreased shoot and root dry biomass, SPAD index, chlorophyll fluorescence, leaf mineral composition and increased foliar proline concentration. Root and leaf-root application of the biostimulant increased fresh yield, dry biomass and root dry weight of lettuce under salinity conditions. This was associated with an improvement of plant nitrogen metabolism and an increase of the Fv/Fm-ratio efficiency in biostimulant-treated plants. Oxidative stress mitigation, increase in osmolytes, changes in sterols and terpenes composition, as well as the less expected increase in glucosinolates were also observed in biostimulant-treated plants grown under saline conditions. The present study proves that the application of plant-derived protein hydrolysate increases plant performance when plants are grown under salinity conditions. The most favorable metabolic profile was obtained when biostimulant was applied to both roots and leaves.},

abstract = {Summary Which factors cause fast-growing plant species to achieve a higher relative growth rate than slow-growing ones? To answer this question 24 wild species were grown from seed in a growth chamber under conditions of optimal nutrient supply and a growth analysis was carried out. Mean relative growth rate, corrected for possible ontogenetic drift, ranged from 113 to 356 mg g−1 day−1. Net assimilation rate, the increase in plant dry weight per unit leaf area and unit time, varied two-fold between species but no correlation with relative growth rate was found. The correlation between leaf area ratio, the ratio between total leaf area and total plant weight, and relative growth rate was very high. This positive correlation was mainly due to the specific leaf area, the ratio between leaf area and leaf weight, and to a lesser extent caused by the leaf weight ratio, the fraction of plant biomass allocated to the leaves. Differences in relative growth rate under conditions of optimum nutrient supply were correlated with the soil fertility in the natural habitat of these species. It is postulated that natural selection in a nutrient-rich environment has favoured species with a high specific leaf area and a high leaf weight ratio, and consequently a high leaf area ratio, whereas selection in nutrient-poor habitats has led to species with an inherently low specific leaf area and a higher fraction of root mass, and thus a low leaf area ratio.},

abstract = {Plant height (PH), a crucial trait related to yield potential in crop plants, is known to be typically quantitatively inherited. However, its full expression can be inhibited by a limited water supply. In this study, the genetic basis of the developmental behaviour of PH was assessed in a 150-line wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) doubled haploid population (Hanxuan 10×Lumai 14) grown in 10 environments (year×site×water regime combinations) by unconditional and conditional quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses in a mixed linear model. Genes that were expressed selectively during ontogeny were identified. No single QTL was continually active in all periods of PH growth, and QTLs with additive effects (A-QTLs) expressed in the period S1{\{}$\backslash$textbar{\}}S0 (the period from the original point to the jointing stage) formed a foundation for PH development. Additive main effects ( a effects), which were mostly expressed in S1{\{}$\backslash$textbar{\}}S0, were more important than epistatic main effects ( aa effects) or QTL×environment interaction ( QE ) effects, suggesting that S1{\{}$\backslash$textbar{\}}S0 was the most significant development period affecting PH growth. A few QTLs, such as QPh.cgb-6B.7 , showed high adaptability for water-limited environments. Many QTLs, including four A-QTLs ( QPh.cgb-2D.1 , QPh.cgb-4B.1 , QPh.cgb-4D.1 , and QPh.cgb-5A.7 ) coincident with previously identified reduced height ( Rht ) genes ( Rht8 , Rht1 , Rht2 , and Rht9 ), interacted with more than one other QTL, indicating that the genetic architecture underlying PH development is a network of genes with additive and epistatic effects. Therefore, based on multilocus combinations in S1{\{}$\backslash$textbar{\}}S0, superior genotypes were predicted for guiding improvements in breeding for PH.},

abstract = {SUMMARYGenotype-environment (GE) interactions as a component of historically rising crop yields are reviewed. For various cereals (both temperate and tropical), past selection has seemingly evoked responsive varieties, and GE effects constitute about one third of the total estimated yield increase due to G + E + GE. In potatoes and sugarcanes, more stable (less responsive) varieties, less dependent upon good environments to do well, have been prominent. Historically, responses have been largely due to unconscious selection, but GE effects could be deliberately manipulated by breeding if it were desirable to do so, for example, to produce varieties adapted to low-input agriculture (already an object of breeding research in a few crops).},

abstract = {Heterosis often occurs in offspring derived from a cross between inbred or divergent parents and can be observed as the superior performance of these hybrids for a wide variety of characters. Heterosis was compared in maize lines at two ploidy levels, diploid and tetraploid, to gain a better understanding of the interaction of heterosis and ploidy level. Employing genetically identical diploid and tetraploid maize derived from four different inbred lines, we investigated heterosis for 11 morphological traits, including several plant height measures, as well as flowering time for both silks and anthers. We find that the heterotic response of a certain hybrid differs between diploid and tetraploid lines, and that the response at one ploidy cannot serve as a predictor for the other. Also, progressive heterosis was found for several of the characters in the tetraploid double-cross hybrid, which can have four different alleles at one locus, compared to the double-cross diploid hybrids, which can only possess two alleles per locus. Overall, the results indicate that the heterotic response of tetraploid maize lines differs significantly from that of the diploid.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to examine the effect of the chicory root powder (CRP) on growth performance and some blood parameters in broiler chickens fed whole wheat (WW) or ground wheat (GW) based diets. A total of 240 one-day old (Ross 308) broiler chickens used in a completely randomised design (with 4 × 2 factorial arrangement), allocated to 8 treatments with 3 replicate and 10 birds per pen. Treatments were a combination of four levels of CRP (0{\%}, 1.5{\%}, 3{\%}, 4.5{\%}) and two forms of wheat grain (whole vs. ground). No differences were found for body weight gain (BWG), feed intake (FI) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) between treatments during starter period (1–21 d). BWG of 4.5{\%} CRP diet fed birds was significantly (p {\{}{\textless}{\}} 0.05) lower than that of control treatment during the growth (21–42 d) and whole trail period (1–42 d). FI and FCR in birds fed CRP diets were not significantly different compared to those of control (free CRP). Feeding WW compared to GW resulted in a significant increase in the relative weight of the gizzard. Feeding 4.5{\%} CRP + GW decreased significantly triglyceride (TG) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)– cholesterol levels, but the total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein–cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein–cholesterol were not affected by dietary treatments. The results shown that feeding CRP up to 4.5{\%} in GW-based diets significantly decreased TG and VLDL–cholesterol concentrations without adverse effects on broilers performance.},

Furthermore, some data arrangement methodologies currently used may be increasing multicollinearity in multiple regression analysis. This study aimed to investigate the statistical behavior of the r and the multicollinearity of correlation matrices among maize traits in different data arrangement scenarios and different sample sizes. Data from 45 treatments [15 simple maize hybrids (Zea mays L.) conducted in three locations] were used. Eleven traits were accessed and three datasets (scenarios) were formed: (1) Coming from all the sampled observations (plants), n = 900; (2) Coming from the average of five plants per plot, n = 180; and (3) Coming from the average of treatments, n = 45. A thousand estimates of r were held in each scenario to 60 sample sizes by bootstrap simulations with replacement. Confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. One hundred eighty correlation matrices were estimated and the condition number (CN) calculated. Data coming from average values of plots and average values of treatments overestimates the r up to 24 and 34{\%}, resulting in an increase of 24 and 131{\%} in the matrices' CN. Trait pairs with high r require a smaller number of plants, being the CI inversely proportional to the magnitude of the r. Two hundred and ten plants are sufficient to estimate the r in the CI of 95{\%} {\textless} 0.30. Key words: Average values, bootstrap, confidence intervals, sample tracking, Zea mays L.},

Thirty-two regression equations are estimated using each method and their performances are evaluated using validation data sets.

Here, we announce the release of Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis version 5 (MEGA5), which is a user-friendly software for mining online databases, building sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees, and using methods of evolutionary bioinformatics in basic biology, biomedicine, and evolution. The newest addition in MEGA5 is a collection of maximum likelihood (ML) analyses for inferring evolutionary trees, selecting best-fit substitution models (nucleotide or amino acid), inferring ancestral states and sequences (along with probabilities), and estimating evolutionary rates site-by-site. In computer simulation analyses, ML tree inference algorithms in MEGA5 compared favorably with other software packages in terms of computational efficiency and the accuracy of the estimates of phylogenetic trees, substitution parameters, and rate variation among sites. The MEGA user interface has now been enhanced to be activity driven to make it easier for the use of both beginners and experienced scientists. This version of MEGA is intended for the Windows platform, and it has been configured for effective use on Mac OS X and Linux desktops. It is available free of charge from http://www.megasoftware.net.},

abstract = {Urea is the worldwide most widespread nitrogen (N) fertilizer and rapidly degraded in soil to ammonium by urease. Ammonium is either taken up by plant roots or is further processed to nitrate by soil microorganisms. However, urea can be taken up by roots and is further degraded to ammonium by plant urease for assimilation. When urea is supplied under sterile conditions, it acts as a poor N-source for seedlings or adult Arabidopsis thaliana plants. Here, the gene expression of young seedlings exposed to urea and ammonium nitrate nutrition was compared. Several primary metabolism and transport genes, including those for nitrate and urea, were differentially expressed in seedlings. However, urease and most major intrinsic proteins were not differentially expressed, with the exception of NIP6;1, a urea permeable channel, which was repressed. Furthermore, little overlap with the gene expression with ammonium as the sole nitrogen source was observed, confirming that pure urea nutrition is not associated with the ammonium toxicity syndrome in seedlings. The direct root uptake of urea was increased under boron deficiency, both in the high and low affinity range. This activity was entirely mediated by the NIP5;1 channel, which was confirmed to transport urea when expressed in oocytes. The uptake of urea in the high and low affinity range was also determined for maize and wheat roots. The urea uptake by maize roots was only about half of that of wheat, but was not stimulated by boron deficiency or nitrogen deficiency in both species. This analysis identifies novel components of the urea uptake systems in plants, which may become agronomically relevant to urea uptake and utilization, as stabilized urea fertilizers become increasingly popular.},

abstract = {A scientific evaluation of the energy efficiency and CO2 emission performance of the thermal power industry could not only provide valuable information for reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions but also serve as a tool to estimate the effectiveness of relevant policy reforms. Considering the opposite effects of energy conservation and carbon emission reduction on generation cost, this study respectively measures the energy and CO2 emission performance of the thermal power industries in China's 30 provincial administrative regions during the period 2005–2012 from both static and dynamic perspectives. We implement the bootstrap method for the directional distance function to correct the possible estimate bias and test the significance of productivity changes where the weak disposability of undesirable outputs is also integrated. The empirical analysis leads to the following conclusions. The bootstrapping results could provide us with much valuable information because the initial estimates might result from sampling noise rather than reveal the real variations. In addition, some differences do exist between the energy and CO2 emission performance of China's thermal power industry. Furthermore, technological progress is the main driving force for energy and CO2 emission productivity improvement and it works better for the former.},

Despite knowing that radiation damages hair, there are no consensus about the particular effect of each segment of solar radiation on the hair shaft. The hair photoprotection products are primarily targeted to dyed hair, specially auburn pigments, and gray shades. They are usually based on silicones, antioxidants and quaternary chemical UV filters that have more affinity for negatively charged hair surface and present higher efficacy. Unfortunately, there are no regulated parameters, like for skin photoprotection, for efficacy evaluation of hair care products, which makes impossible to compare the results published in the literature. Thus, it is important that researchers make an effort to apply experimental conditions similar to a real level of sun exposure, like dose, irradiance, time, temperature and relative humidity.},

While the tangible results of this work have been several visualization software libraries, this book focuses on the deep structures involved in producing quantitative graphics from data. What are the rules that underlie the production of pie charts, bar charts, scatterplots, function plots, maps, mosaics, and radar charts? Those less interested in the theoretical and mathematical foundations can still get a sense of the richness and structure of the system by examining the numerous and often unique color graphics it can produce. The second edition is almost twice the size of the original, with six new chapters and substantial revision. Much of the added material makes this book suitable for survey courses in visualization and statistical graphics.},

We propose an intuitive, effective approach to diagnosing the presence of multicollinearity and its remedies in this class of models. A simulation study demonstrates the impacts of multicollinearity on coefficient estimates, associated standard errors, and variance components at various levels of multicollinearity for finite sample sizes typical in social science studies. We further investigate the role multicollinearity plays at each level for estimation of coefficient parameters in terms of shrinkage. Based on these analyses, we recommend a top-down method for assessing multicollinearity in HLMs that first examines the contextual predictors (Level-2 in a two-level model) and then the individual predictors (Level-1) and uses the results for data collection, research problem redefinition, model re-specification, variable selection and estimation of a final model.},

Data were collected on days to anthesis and silking, anthesis-silking interval, plant and ear heights, number of ears per plant, leaf area, ear weight and grain yield. Mean values were used to determine characters' phenotypic and genotypic variances, phenotypic, genotypic and environmental coefficients of variation. Broad sense heritability and genetic advance percentage of mean were estimated for each trait. Significant variation existed in all the characters. The coefficients of variation were low except for ear weight and grain yield that were relatively higher. The anthesis-silking interval was highest in lines TZEI 124 and TZEI 16, but least in lines BD74-222, TZEI 11 and TZEI 13. Line BD74-222 had the height plant height and BD74-165 had the least. Line TZEI 124 produced highest maize grain yield whereas line TZEI 146 had the least. Coefficients of variation of phenotype and genotype were low for all the traits except number of ear per plant, ear and grain yield. The characters were less influenced by the environment thus the traits can be used for selection. Heritability was greater than 80{\%} for all characters studied whereas expected genetic advance ranged from low (8.91) in days to silking to high (72.03) in number of ear per plant. Days to anthesis and silking, plant height and number of leaf per plant were positively correlated. Grain yield was positively correlated with ASI, plant and ear heights, number of leaf per plant and leaf area. High heritability and high genetic advance for ASI indicated the presence of additive genes in the trait and suggested reliable maize improvement through selection of the traits. In this study moderate genetic advance was associated with high heritability.},

abstract = {Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merrill) is the most important leguminous crop in the world due to the high contents of protein and oil, and accumulation of various physiologically active substances. However, most of the genomic and economic traits in soybean are quantitative, controlled by multiple genes and easily affected by environmental conditions. Based on recombinant inbred lines (F8), a genetic linkage map with 177 RFLP, 150 SSR, 28 AFLP markers and 5 phenotypic markers was constructed. The map covered a distance of 2663.6 cM of the soybean genome comprising 20 linkage groups. The average distance between two adjacent marker loci was 7.89 cM. In this population, we detected thirty-nine QTLs for all the reproductive development and seed quality traits investigated, that is, three for flowering time (FT1–3), four for maturity (HAV1–4), three for reproductive period (RP1–3), three for seed hardness (RAS1–3), five for viability of seed (VIS1–5), four for germination rate of seed (GRS1–4), five for water absorbability of seed (WAS1–5) and twelve QTLs for seed weight (SWE1–6 and SWH1–6). Out of these QTLs, twenty-eight were detected in nearly the same regions of the linkage map by both IM (interval mapping) and CIM (composite interval mapping) analysis. The proportion of variance explained of these QTLs ranged from 3.4{\%} to 67.1{\%}. Epistatic interactions were detected among various QTLs. Especially there was a strong interaction among the effects of FT1 and FT2, and FT1 and FT3. Multiple correlation coefficients between FT1 and FT2, and FT1 and FT3 accounted for 79.6{\%} and 74.1{\%} of the phenotypic variation of flowering time, respectively.},

A major advantage of such spatial organization is the transfer of biosynthetic intermediates between catalytic sites without diffusion into the bulk phase of the cell. This so-called “metabolic channeling” offers unique opportunities for enhancing and regulating cellular biochemistry. Studies in a number of plant primary and secondary metabolic systems continue to contribute to our understanding of the nature and importance of this phenomenon. This article reviews advances in four systems: the cysteine synthase complex, the Calvin cycle, cyanogenic glucoside biosynthesis, and the phenylpropanoid pathway. Each of these systems is providing new evidence for the importance of enzyme organization in cellular biochemistry as well as exclusive insights into the molecular basis of enzyme complex assembly. This review also explores current prospects for understanding metabolon structure, assembly, and biological function.},

Chandler under drip (DI) and surface irrigation (SI) systems. Unmulch (UM) and rainfed treatments were kept as control. Higher soil moisture content was registered under both the mulch materials during entire crop growth period. However, it was greater under BP mulch as compare to HM. The moisture conservation increased by 2.80–12.80{\%} under BP mulch as compared to UM. HM treatment, irrespective of irrigation method increased the minimum soil temperature (2.8–5.2 °C) and reduced the maximum soil temperature (2.7–5.8 °C) as compared to UM. BP mulch increased the minimum soil temperature from 0.4 to 2.5 °C. Application of irrigation moderated the soil (minimum 2.6 and maximum 1.4 °C) temperature. Both the mulch materials were effective in enhancing root growth, nutrient uptake, WUE and yield. Application of mulch enhanced the root growth (63{\%}), nutrient uptake (179.20{\%}), WUE (84.40{\%}) and yield (343{\%}) under DI. However, respective increase under SI was 23.60, 83.80, 109.40 and 219.20{\%}. Under DI, 51{\%} of irrigation water was saved and about 19{\%} higher fruit yield was obtained as compared with SI treatment.

abstract = {To study the genetic variability and the genetic basis of nitrogen (N) use efficiency in maize, a set of recombinant inbred lines crossed with a tester was studied at low input (N–) and high input (N+) for grain yield and its components, grain protein content, and post‐anthesis nitrogen uptake and remobilization. Other physiological traits, such as nitrate content, nitrate reductase, glutamine synthetase (GS), and glutamate dehydrogenase activities were studied at the level of the lines. Genotype×nitrogen (G×N) interaction was significant for yield and explained by variation in kernel number. In N–, N‐uptake, the nitrogen nutrition index, and GS activity in the vegetative stage were positively correlated with grain yield, whereas leaf senescence was negatively correlated. Whatever N‐input, post‐anthesis N‐uptake was highly negatively related to N‐remobilization. As a whole, genetic variability was expressed differently in N+ and N–. This was confirmed by the detection of QTLs. More QTLs were detected in N+ than in N– for traits of vegetative development, N‐uptake, and grain yield and its components, whereas it was the reverse for grain protein content and N‐utilization efficiency. Several coincidences between genes encoding for enzymes of N metabolism and QTLs for the traits studied were observed. In particular, coincidences in three chromosome regions of QTLs for yield and N‐remobilization, QTLs for GS activity and a gene encoding cytosolic GS were observed. This may have a physiological meaning. The GS locus on chromosome 5 appears to be a good candidate gene which can, at least partially, explain the variation in nitrogen use efficiency.},

abstract = {Cladosporium fulvum is a non-obligate biotrophic fungal tomato pathogen for which fifteen secondary metabolite (SM) gene clusters were previously identified in its genome. However, most of these SM biosynthetic pathways remain cryptic during growth in planta and in different in vitro conditions. The sole SM produced in vitro is the pigment cladofulvin. In this study, we attempted to activate cryptic pathways in order to identify new compounds produced by C. fulvum. For this purpose, we manipulated orthologues of the global regulators VeA, LaeA and HdaA known to regulate SM biosynthesis in other fungal species. In C. fulvum, deleting or over-expressing these regulators yielded no new detectable SMs. Yet, quantification of cladofulvin revealed that CfHdaA is an activator whilst CfVeA and CfLaeA seemed to act as repressors of cladofulvin production. In the wild type strain, cladofulvin biosynthesis was affected by the carbon source, with highest production under carbon limitation and traces only in presence of saccharose. Repression of cladofulvin production by saccharose was dependent on both CfVeA and CfLaeA. Deletion of CfVeA or CfLaeA caused production of sterile mycelia, whilst $\Delta$cfhdaa deletion mutants sporulated, suggesting that cladofulvin production is not linked to asexual reproduction. Profiling the transcription of these regulators showed that CfHdaA-mediated regulation of cladofulvin production is independent of both CfVeA and CfLaeA. Our data suggest CfLaeA directly affects cladofulvin production whilst the effect of CfVeA is indirect, suggesting a role for CfLaeA outside of the Velvet complex. In conclusion, our results showed that regulation of SM production in C. fulvum is different from other fungi and indicate that manipulation of global regulators is not a universal tool to discover new fungal natural products.},

abstract = {Pearson's correlation coefficient, rxy, is often used when measuring the influence of one time-dependent variable on another in bivariate climate time series. Thereby, positive serial dependence (persistence) and unknown data distributions impose a challenge for obtaining accurate confidence intervals for rxy. This is met by the presented approach, employing the nonparametric stationary bootstrap with an average block length proportional to the maximum estimated persistence time of the data. A Monte Carlo experiment reveals that this method can produce accurate (in terms of coverage) confidence intervals (of type bias-corrected and accelerated). However, since persistence reduces the number of independent observations, substantially more data points are required for achieving an accuracy comparable to a situation without persistence. The experiment further shows that neglecting serial dependence may lead to serious coverage errors. The presented method proves robust with respect to distributional shape (lognormal/normal) and time spacing (uneven/even). The method is used to confirm that a previous finding of a correlation between solar activity and Indian Ocean monsoon strength in early Holocene is valid. A further result is that the correlation between sunspot number and cosmogenic 10Be concentration vanishes after approximately 1870.},

Different threshing mechanisms and their adjustments may also affect the intensity of impacts that machines cause on seeds. So, this study aimed at diagnosing and evaluating the effect of two combines: the first one with a threshing system of axial flow and the other one with a threshing system of tangential flow, under adjustments of concave opening (10 mm, 30 mm and 10 mm for a combine with axial flow and 3.0 mm, 15 mm and 3.0 mm for a combine with tangential flow) and three cylinder rotations on the quality of soybean seeds harvested at two moisture contents. Soybean seeds of cultivar 'ND 4910' were harvested at 16.6{\%} moisture (mid-morning) and 13.7{\%} moisture in the afternoon. The seeds quality was evaluated by germination tests, germination speed index (GSI), germination rate, moisture content, percentage of purity and vigor by tetrazolium test. Despite the combine, the results showed that the mechanical injury has most reduced seeds quality, at 16.6{\%} moisture content, concave opening of 30 mm (axial) and 10 mm (tangential) and cylinder rotation of 1100 rpm (axial) and 1000 (tangential), both with the highest rotations used. The combine with tangential flow had the highest degree of seeds purity. When seeds moisture content at harvest was close to 13.7{\%}, there was the highest seed injury, while, at 16.6{\%}, there was the highest number of crushed soybeans, regardless the combine adjustment.Key words: Glycine max; Combines adjustment; Cylinder rotation.},

abstract = {It has long been suspected that maize is the product of an historical tetraploid event. Several observations support this possibility, including the fact that the maize genome contains duplicated chromosomal segments with colinear gene arrangements. Some of the genes from these duplicated segments have been sequenced. In this study, we examine the pattern of sequence divergence among 14 pairs of duplicated genes. We compare the pattern of divergence to patterns predicted by four models of the evolution of the maize genome—autotetraploidy, genomic allotetraploidy, segmental allotetraploidy, and multiple segmental duplications. Our analyses indicate that coalescent times for duplicated sequences fall into two distinct groups, corresponding to roughly 20.5 and 11.4 million years. This observation strongly discounts the possibility that the maize genome is the product of a genomic allotetraploid event, and it is also difficult to reconcile with either autotetraploidy or multiple independent segmental duplications. However, the presence of two (and only two) coalescent times is predicted by the segmental allotetraploid model. If the maize genome is the product of a segmental allotetraploid event, as these data suggest, then its two diploid progenitors diverged roughly 20.5 million years ago (Mya), and the allotetraploid event probably occurred approximately 11.4 Mya. Comparison of maize and sorghum sequences suggests that one of the two ancestral diploids shares a more recent common ancestor with sorghum than it does with the other ancestral diploid.},

The disparity between net deposition rates and net exogenous influx of NH4+ indicated that growing cells imported NH4+ from more mature tissue, whereas more mature root tissues assimilated or translocated a portion of the NH4+ absorbed. Net root NO3– influx under Ca(NO3)2 nutrition was adequate to account for pools found in the growth zone and provided twice as much as was deposited locally throughout the non-growing tissue. In contrast, net root NO3– influx under NH4NO3 was less than the local deposition rate in the growth zone, indicating that additional NO3– was imported or metabolically produced. The profile of NO3– deposition rate in the growth zone, however, was similar for the plants receiving Ca(NO3)2 or NH4NO3. These results suggest that NO3– may serve a major role as an osmoticant for supporting root elongation in the basal part of the growth zone and maintaining root function in the young mature tissues.},

The enzyme preparation when analysed on SDS–PAGE, displayed a single protein band with Mr 33 kDa; Superdex 200 column showed Mr of 32 kDa and MS/MS analysis further provided support for these values. The enzyme displayed its optimum catalytic activity at pH 5.0 and 68 °C with an activation energy of 6.66 kcal/mol and Q10 1.42. The primary substrate for this hydrolase appears to be starch with Km 1.56 mg/mL, Vmax 1666.67 U/mg and kcat 485 s−1 and hence is suitable for application in starch based industries. Thermal inactivation of $\alpha$-amylase at 67 °C resulted in first-order kinetics with rate constant (k) 0.0086 min−1 and t1/2 80 min. The enzyme was susceptible to EDTA (10 mM) with irreversible loss of hydrolytic power. In the presence of 1.0 mM SDS, the enzyme lost only 14{\%} and 23{\%} activity in 24 and 48 h, respectively. Chemical modification studies showed that the enzyme contains histidine and carboxylic residues at its active site for its catalytic activity and possibly conserved areas.},

Tolerance to such a stress can be achieved by constitutive gene expression or by rapid changes in gene expression, which ultimately leads to protection against thermal damage. We have used cDNA-AFLP and microarray analyses to compare the early response of the tomato meiotic anther transcriptome to moderate heat stress conditions (32°C) in a heat-tolerant and a heat-sensitive tomato genotype. In the light of the expected global temperature increases, elucidating such protective mechanisms and identifying candidate tolerance genes can be used to improve breeding strategies for crop tolerance to heat stress.},

We have used sequential pearling to produce flour fractions enriched in particular cell layers to determine the protein gradients in four different cultivars grown at two nitrogen levels. The results show that the steepness of the protein gradient is determined by both genetic and nutritional factors, with three high-protein breadmaking cultivars being more responsive to the N treatment than a low-protein cultivar suitable for livestock feed. Nitrogen also affected the relative abundances of the three main classes of wheat prolamins: the sulfur-poor ?-gliadins showed the greatest response to nitrogen and increased evenly across the grain; the HMW subunits also increased in response to nitrogen but proportionally more in the outer layers of the starchy endosperm than near the core, while the sulfur-rich prolamins showed the opposite trend.},

The results showed that different irrigation levels applied has statistically significant effect on yield components such as anthesis–silking interval, plant height, ear diameter, ear length, kernel number and 1000 grain weight, except for ear number. In both of the genotypes, water deficit stress significantly (P ≤ 0.01) increased glucose, fructose, and sucrose contents while it decreased protein content. The maximum grain yield was obtained from Şafak genotype under full irrigation, slight, mild, severe and full water deficit stress as much as 9.35 t ha−1, 8.34 t ha−1, 7.89 t ha−1, 5.56 t ha−1 and 3.63 t ha−1, respectively. The highest water use was observed in I100 treatment as 738.1 mm for Şafak genotype, while the lowest was found in I0 treatment as 260.0 mm for Ant-İ90 genotype. The highest water use efficiency was found in I50 as 15.7 kg ha−1 mm−1 for Şafak genotype, and the lowest one was found in I0 as 5.5 kg ha−1 mm−1 for Ant-İ90.

abstract = {Studies on plant secondary metabolites have been increasing over the last 50 years. These molecules are known to play a major role in the adaptation of plants to their environment, but also represent an important source of active pharmaceuticals. Plant cell culture technologies were introduced at the end of the 1960s as a possible tool for both studying and producing plant secondary metabolites. Different strategies, using in vitro systems, have been extensively studied with the objective of improving the production of secondary plant compounds. Undifferentiated cell cultures have been mainly studied, but a large interest has also been shown in hairy roots and other organ cultures. Specific processes have been designed to meet the requirements of plant cell and organ cultures in bioreactors. Despite all of these efforts of the last 30 years, plant biotechnologies have led to very few commercial successes for the production of valuable secondary compounds. Compared to other biotechnological fields such as microorganisms or mammalian cell cultures, this can be explained by a lack of basic knowledge about biosynthetic pathways, or insufficiently adapted reactor facilities. More recently, the emergence of recombinant DNA technology has opened a new field with the possibility of directly modifying the expression of genes related to biosyntheses. It is now possible to manipulate the pathways that lead to secondary plant compounds. Many research projects are now currently being carried out and should give a promising future for plant metabolic engineering.},

Wells) on partitioning of 14C into assimilates following exposure of a soybean leaf to 14CO2 by both steady-state and pulse-labeling techniques was studied. Blades on the second fully expanded leaf from the stem apex were exposed to 14CO2. Radioactive assimilates were extracted from source leaf blades, petioles, and stems (both the path up and path down from source leaf), were separated into neutral (sugars), basic (amino acids), and acidic (organic acids, sugar phosphates) fractions by ion exchange chromatography. The basic fraction was further resolved using thin layer chromatography and the percentage of radioactivity recovered in each amino acid was determined.
The distribution of radioactivity in the neutral, basic, and acidic fractions of the source leaf blades was significantly different from that of the transport path (petiole and stems). About 70{\%} of the radioactivity in source leaf blades was recovered in the neutral fraction, whereas about 90{\%} of the recovered radioactivity in the path was in the neutral fraction. 14C-Aminoacids constituted 8 to 17{\%} and 2 to 7{\%} of the recovered radioactivity in source leaves and paths, respectively. Recovered 14C in organic acids ranged from 13 to 20{\%} and 2 to 7{\%} in source leaves and paths, respectively. Partitioning of 14C-assimilates among the neutral, basic, and acidic fractions was not affected by the presence of nodules or flowers. However, when steady-state labeling was compared to pulse labeling, a significantly lower percentage of 14C was recovered in the neutral fraction with a concomitant increase in the basic fraction. Asparagine-arginine, serine, glutamate, $\gamma$-aminobutyrate-alanine, and aspartate accounted for 69 to 85{\%} of the recovered radioactivity in the basic fraction from the various treatments. [14C]Serine was significantly higher in pulse-labeling experiments, whereas glutamtate and proline were higher with steady-state labeling. [14C]Serine was significantly higher in nonnodulated plants than in nodulated plants, whereas $\gamma$-aminobutyrate-alanine was significantly higher in preflowering plants as compared to flowering plants.},

abstract = {New methods that incorporate the main and interaction effects of high-dimensional markers and of high-dimensional environmental covariates gave increased prediction accuracy of grain yield in wheat across and within environments. In most agricultural crops the effects of genes on traits are modulated by environmental conditions, leading to genetic by environmental interaction (G × E). Modern genotyping technologies allow characterizing genomes in great detail and modern information systems can generate large volumes of environmental data. In principle, G × E can be accounted for using interactions between markers and environmental covariates (ECs). However, when genotypic and environmental information is high dimensional, modeling all possible interactions explicitly becomes infeasible. In this article we show how to model interactions between high-dimensional sets of markers and ECs using covariance functions. The model presented here consists of (random) reaction norm where the genetic and environmental gradients are described as linear functions of markers and of ECs, respectively. We assessed the proposed method using data from Arvalis, consisting of 139 wheat lines genotyped with 2,395 SNPs and evaluated for grain yield over 8 years and various locations within northern France. A total of 68 ECs, defined based on five phases of the phenology of the crop, were used in the analysis. Interaction terms accounted for a sizable proportion (16 {\%}) of the within-environment yield variance, and the prediction accuracy of models including interaction terms was substantially higher (17-34 {\%}) than that of models based on main effects only. Breeding for target environmental conditions has become a central priority of most breeding programs. Methods, like the one presented here, that can capitalize upon the wealth of genomic and environmental information available, will become increasingly important.},

abstract = {Genotype × environment interaction (GEI) is an important aspect of both plant breeding and the successful introduction of new cultivars. In the present study, additive main effects and multiplicative interactions (AMMI) and genotype (G) main effects and genotype (G) × environment (E) interaction (GGE) biplot analyses were used to identify stable genotypes and to dissect GEI in Plantago. In total, 10 managed field trials were considered as environments to analyze GEI in thirty genotypes belonging to eight Plantago species. Genotypes were evaluated in a drought stress treatment and in normal irrigation conditions at two locations in Shiraz (Bajgah) for three years (2013-2014- 2015) and Kooshkak (Marvdasht, Fars, Iran) for two years (2014–2015). Three traits, seed yield and mucilage yield and content, were measured at each experimental site and in natural Plantago habitats. AMMI2 biplot analyses identified genotypes from several species with higher stability for seed yield and other genotypes with stable mucilage content and yield. P. lanceolata (G26), P. officinalis (G10), P. ovata (G14), P. ampleexcaulis (G11) and P. major (G4) had higher stability for seed yield. For mucilage yield, G21, G18 and G20 (P. psyllium), G1, G2 and G4 (P. major), G9 and G10 (P. officinalis) and P. lanceolata were identified as stable. G13 (P. ovata), G5 and G6 (P. major) and G30 (P. lagopus) had higher stability for mucilage content. No one genotype was found to have high levels of stability for more than one trait but some species had more than one genotype exhibiting stable trait performance. Based on trait variation, GGE biplot analysis identified two representative environments, one for seed yield and one for mucilage yield and content, with good discriminating ability. The identification of stable genotypes and representative environments should assist the breeding of new Plantago cultivars.},

The structure and morphology of composites were investigated by X-ray powder diffractometer, scanning electron microscope and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The characterized results indicated that porous carbon was formed due to the decomposition of lignin, and CeO2 nanorods are grown uniformly in the porous carbon to form porous carbon–CeO2 composites. The prepared porous carbon–CeO2 composites were used for the photocatalytic removal of SO2 at room temperature under light irradiation. The photocatalytic activity of carbon–CeO2 was greatly enhanced compared with CeO2. The maximum of photocatalytic conversion of SO2 can be about 51.89{\%} much higher than that of CeO2. The possible mechanism for the photocatalytic oxidation of SO2 was proposed based on the experimental results, and the prepared composites may have potential application for the SO2 removal in actual life.},

abstract = {Summary Variable selection can be challenging, particularly in situations with a large number of predictors with possibly high correlations, such as gene expression data. In this article, a new method called the OSCAR (octagonal shrinkage and clustering algorithm for regression) is proposed to simultaneously select variables while grouping them into predictive clusters. In addition to improving prediction accuracy and interpretation, these resulting groups can then be investigated further to discover what contributes to the group having a similar behavior. The technique is based on penalized least squares with a geometrically intuitive penalty function that shrinks some coefficients to exactly zero. Additionally, this penalty yields exact equality of some coefficients, encouraging correlated predictors that have a similar effect on the response to form predictive clusters represented by a single coefficient. The proposed procedure is shown to compare favorably to the existing shrinkage and variable selection techniques in terms of both prediction error and model complexity, while yielding the additional grouping information.},

abstract = {Optimal defense theory (ODT) predicts that the within-plant quantitative allocation of defenses is not random, but driven by the potential relative contribution of particular plant tissues to overall fitness. These predictions have been poorly tested on long-lived woody plants. We explored the allocation of constitutive and methyl-jasmonate (MJ) inducible chemical defenses in six half-sib families of Pinus radiata juveniles. Specifically, we studied the quantitative allocation of resin and polyphenolics (the two major secondary chemicals in pine trees) to tissues with contrasting fitness value (stem phloem, stem xylem and needles) across three parts of the plants (basal, middle and apical upper part), using nitrogen concentration as a proxy of tissue value. Concentration of nitrogen in the phloem, xylem and needles was found to be greater higher up the plant. As predicted by the ODT, the same pattern was found for the concentration of non-volatile resin in the stem. However, in leaf tissues the concentrations of both resin and total phenolics were greater towards the base of the plant. Two weeks after MJ application, the concentrations of nitrogen in the phloem, resin in the stem and total phenolics in the needles increased by roughly 25{\%} compared with the control plants, inducibility was similar across all plant parts, and families differed in the inducibility of resin compounds in the stem. In contrast, no significant changes were observed either for phenolics in the stems, or for resin in the needles after MJ application. Concentration of resin in the phloem was double that in the xylem and MJ-inducible, with inducibility being greater towards the base of the stem. In contrast, resin in the xylem was not MJ-inducible and increased in concentration higher up the plant. The pattern of inducibility by MJ-signaling in juvenile P. radiata is tissue, chemical-defense and plant-part specific, and is genetically variable.},

The heading ratio of tillers was lower in Shinchunaga than in Omasekomugi. The top dry weight increment ($\Delta$D) for one week and total nitrogen content (N content) one week after transfer to greenhouse-longday, condition were larger in vigorous tillers of Shinchunaga than in those of Omasekomugi, and larger in weak tillers of Omasekomugi than in those of Shinchunaga. The thresholds of $\Delta$D and N content of the tillers where the heading ratio dropped below 100{\%} were higher in Shinchunaga than in Omasekomugi. Two weeks after transfer to greenhouse-longday condition, when tillers clearly belonged to one of the two types, namely, heading and non-heading, the tillers of heading type had larger dry weight, higher N content and higher nitrogen absorption ability than the other. In Norin 29, the $\Delta$D of the vigorous tillers for one week after the daylength treatment started was larger in the longday plot and that of the weak tillers was larger in the shortday plof N content was higher in the heading tillers than in the non-heading tillers. There was no difference in N content in the heading tillers between those of the longday plot and the shortday plot. Until the tillers started to grow independently with their elongated roots, their growth and nitrogen absorption ability proportionately declined to their heading ratio.},

The Euclidean random matrix is given by M n = ( f ( ‖ x i − x j ‖ 2 ) ) n × n where ‖ ⋅ ‖ is the Euclidean distance. When N is fixed and n → ∞ we prove that $\mu$ ˆ ( M n ) , the empirical distribution of the eigenvalues of M n , converges to $\delta$ 0 for a big class of functions of f ( x ) . Assuming both N and n go to infinity proportionally, we obtain the explicit limit of $\mu$ ˆ ( M n ) when G is the l p unit ball or sphere with p ⩾ 1 . As corollaries, we obtain the limit of $\mu$ ˆ ( A n ) with A n = ( d ( x i , x j ) ) n × n and d being the geodesic distance on the ordinary unit sphere in R N . We also obtain the limit of $\mu$ ˆ ( A n ) for the Euclidean distance matrix A n = ( ‖ x i − x j ‖ ) n × n . The limits are a + b V where a and b are constants and V follows the Mar{\v{c}}enko–Pastur law. The same are also obtained for other examples appeared in physics literature including ( exp ⁡ ( − ‖ x i − x j ‖ $\gamma$ ) ) n × n and ( exp ⁡ ( − d ( x i , x j ) $\gamma$ ) ) n × n .

abstract = {Medinilla magnifica Lindl. (Melastomataceae), a Philippine-native shrub, has been found to produce diverse polyphenolic compounds, including novel forms of tannins with bioactive properties. Despite the great deal of explorations that were made on the tannin constituents of the plant, localization of the compounds in its organs has not been described. Taking this into consideration, we examined the anatomy of M. magnifica with particular focus on the distribution patterns of tannins in its vegetative and reproductive organs. Analyses were performed by scanning electron and light microscopy where tannin cells were made prominent by histochemical stains and iron salt solution. It was revealed that tannin cells have relatively defined patterns of distribution in the plant organs, with specificity of accumulation around or near the vascular tissues. The leaf amassed tannins in the palisade mesophyll and in the ground tissues surrounding the veins with greater concentration at the apical region. Tannins were less abundant in the stems and adventitious roots but were still concentrated near the vascular tissues. The reproductive structures displayed a decreasing tannin concentration through maturation but with maintained density in tissues surrounding the carpel until fruit-set. The site-specific distribution of tannin cells could indicate their protective role to vital structures against pathogens and herbivores, whereas the decrease of tannins in the tissues of developing flowers and fruits could be an apparent adaptation to make the fruits more palatable to potential seed dispersers.},

abstract = {This article discusses the dynamics of a diameter distribution in stands of black wattle throughout its growth cycle using the Weibull probability density function. Moreover, the parameters of this distribution were related to environmental variables from meteorological data and surface soil horizon with the aim of finding a model for diameter distribution which their coefficients were related to the environmental variables. We found that the diameter distribution of the stand changes only slightly over time and that the estimators of the Weibull function are correlated with various environmental variables, with accumulated rainfall foremost among them. Thus, a model was obtained in which the estimators of the Weibull function are dependent on rainfall. Such a function can have important applications, such as in simulating growth potential in regions where historical growth data is lacking, as well as the behavior of the stand under different environmental conditions. The model can also be used to project growth in diameter, based on the rainfall affecting the forest over a certain time period.},

abstract = {The expansion of biogas production from anaerobic digestion in the Po Valley (Northern Italy) has stimulated the cultivation of dedicated biomass crops, and maize in particular. A mid-term experiment was carried out from 2006 to 2010 on a silt loamy soil in Northern Italy to compare water use and energy efficiency of maize and sorghum cultivation under rain fed and well-watered treatments and at two rates of nitrogen fertilization. The present work hypothesis were: (i) biomass sorghum, for its efficient use of water and nitrogen, could be a valuable alternative to maize for biogas production; (ii) reduction of irrigation level and (iii) application of low nitrogen fertilizer rate increase the efficiency of bioenergy production. Water treatments, a rain fed control (I0) and two irrigation levels (I1 and I2; only one in 2006 and 2009), were compared in a split–split plot design with four replicates. Two fertilizer rates were also tested: low (N1, 60 kg ha−1 of nitrogen; 0 kg ha−1 of nitrogen in 2010) and high (N2, 120 kg ha−1 of nitrogen; 100 kg ha−1 of nitrogen in 2010). Across treatments, sorghum produced more aboveground biomass than maize, respectively 21.6 Mg ha−1 and 16.8 Mg ha−1 (p {\textless} 0.01). In both species, biomass yield was lower in I0 than in I1 and I2 (p {\textless} 0.01), while I1 and I2 did differ significantly. Nitrogen level never affected biomass yield. Water use efficiency was generally higher in sorghum (52 kg ha−1 mm−1) than in maize (38 kg ha−1 mm−1); the significant interaction between crop and irrigation revealed that water use efficiency did not differ across water levels in sorghum, whereas it significantly increased from I0 and I1 to I2 in maize (p {\textless} 0.01). The potential methane production was similar in maize and sorghum, while it was significantly lower in I0 (16505 MJ ha−1) than in I1 and I2 (21700 MJ ha−1). The only significant effect of nitrogen fertilization was found in the calculation of energy efficiency (ratio of energy output and input) that was higher in N1 than in N2 (p {\textless} 0.01). These results support the hypothesis that (i) sorghum should be cultivated rather than maize to increase energy efficiency, (ii) irrigation level should replace up to 36{\%} of ETr and (iii) nitrogen fertilizer rate should be minimized to maximize the efficiency in biomass production for anaerobic digestion in the Po Valley.},

Ten corn hybrids were evaluated for grain yield in 48 environments, consisting of 12 locations over a period of four years in South Brazil. A complete experimental, random block design with two repetitions was used. Adaptability and stability were analyzed according to the bi-segmented discontinuous model with measurement errors in the variables. The behavior of hybrids was studied as a function of the average yield in the inferior and/or superior environments, the estimates of the parameters of the equation, and the quality of the fit. The 30F36 hybrid behaved better in the superior environments and it is indicated for farmers who adopt the highest technological standards for crop management, whereas the 30F53 hybrid was classified as close to ideal; that is, it is indicated for cultivation under various environmental conditions. The 30R50 and 32R48 hybrids are appropriate only for average environments. There is a very good phenotypic stability in simple hybrids associated with high potential yield.},

The variance-stability features of Fisher׳s z-transform on PRVCC is also investigated under normal assumptions. To gain deeper insight into PRVCC, we further compare PRVCC to other two closely related correlation coefficients, namely, Pearson׳s product moment correlation coefficient (PPMCC) and Gini correlation (GC). Theoretical and simulation results reveal the advantages of PRVCC over PPMCC and/or GC in terms of mathematical tractability and smaller mean square error (MSE) under different circumstances. The newly found theoretical results along with other desirable properties enable PRVCC to be a useful alternative to the existing coefficients, especially when the samples follow distributions whose tails are heavier than that of normal distribution.},

Enhanced UV-B radiation decreased plant height, dry weight of individual stem and yield per plant of three soybean cultivars on average by 15.5{\%}, 16.9{\%} and 43.7{\%}, respectively. Pod number per plant was the most responsible component for yield change under UV-B radiation in the 2-year study. Seed number per pod was less affected by change in light treatment in our experiment, compared with the pod number per plant. UV-B radiation had no significant effect on effective filling period, however, seed size was negatively impacted by UV-B radiation and it decreased 12.3{\%} for three soybean cultivars. Reduction of seed size was mainly due to the decrease of cotyledon cell number. Enhanced UV-B radiation had no significant effect on cotyledon cell volume, cell growth rate or cell weight. Our results suggested that the reduction of seed ABA concentration was directly responsible for lower cotyledon cell number under enhanced UV-B radiation.},

abstract = {Information on genetic diversity is essential to the characterization and utilization of germplasm. The genetic diversity of twenty-two sweet corn cultivars (seventeen open-pollinated varieties, OPV, and five hybrids, H) was investigated by applying simple sequence repeat markers. A total of 257 primers were tested, of which 160 were found to be usable in terms of high reproducibility for all the samples tested; 45 were polymorphic loci, of which 30 were used to assess the genetic diversity of sweet corn cultivars. We detected a total of 86 alleles using 30 microsatellite primers. The mean polymorphism was 82 {\%}. The highest heterozygosity values (Ho = 0.20) were found in the PR030-Doce Flor da Serra and BR427 III OPVs, whereas the lowest values (0.14) were recorded in the MG161-Branco Doce and Doce Cubano OPVs. The polymorphism information content ranged from 0.19 (Umc2319) to 0.71 (Umc2205). The analysis of molecular variance revealed that most of the genetic variability was concentrated within the cultivars of sweet corn (75 {\%}), with less variability between them (25 {\%}). The consensus tree derived from the neighbor-joining (NJ) algorithm using 1,000 bootstrapping replicates revealed seven genetically different groups. Nei's diversity values varied between 0.103 (Doce do Hawai × CNPH-1 cultivars) and 0.645 (Amarelo Doce × Lili cultivars), indicating a narrow genetic basis. The Lili hybrid was the most distant cultivar, as revealed by Principal Coordinates Analysis and the NJ tree. This study on genetic diversity will be useful for planning future studies on sweet corn genetic resources and can complement the breeding programs for this crop.Key words: simple sequence repeats; neighbor-joining; maize germplasm},

abstract = {The Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) and tolerance are both widely used measures of the degree of multi-collinearity of the ith independent variable with the other independent variables in a regression model. Unfortunately, several rules of thumb – most commonly the rule of 10 – associated with VIF are regarded by many practitioners as a sign of severe or serious multi-collinearity (this rule appears in both scholarly articles and advanced statistical textbooks). When VIF reaches these threshold values researchers often attempt to reduce the collinearity by eliminating one or more variables from their analysis; using Ridge Regression to analyze their data; or combining two or more independent variables into a single index. These techniques for curing problems associated with multi-collinearity can create problems more serious than those they solve. Because of this, we examine these rules of thumb and find that threshold values of the VIF (and tolerance) need to be evaluated in the context of several other factors that influence the variance of regression coefficients. Values of the VIF of 10, 20, 40, or even higher do not, by themselves, discount the results of regression analyses, call for the elimination of one or more independent variables from the analysis, suggest the use of ridge regression, or require combining of independent variable into a single index.},

An analogous argument is employed to derive a criterion for use with the within-group sum-of-squares objective function trace (W). The behaviour of both Marriott's criterion and the new criterion is investigated by Monte Carlo methods. For homogeneous data based on uniform and independent variables, the performance of the new criterion is close to expectation while Marriott's criterion shows much more extreme behaviour. For grouped data, the new criterion correctly identifies the number of groups in 85{\%} of data sets under a wide range of conditions, while Marriott's criterion shows a success rate of less than 40{\%}. The new criterion is illustrated on the well-known Iris data, and some cautionary comments are made about its use.},

Knowing the productive variability within protected environments is crucial for choosing the experimental design to be used in that conditions. Thus, the aim of the present study was to assess the variability of fruit production in protected environment cultivated with cherry tomatoes and to verify the border effect and plot size in reducing this variability. To this, data from an uniformity test carried out in a greenhouse with cherry tomato cv. ‘Lili' were used. Total fresh mass of fruits per plant was considered being these plants arranged in cropping rows parallel to the lateral openings of the greenhouse and also the same plants arranged in columns perpendicular to these openings. To generate the borders, different scenarios were designed by excluding rows and columns and using different plot sizes. In each scenario, homogeneity of variances among the remaining rows and columns was tested. There is no variability of fruit production among rows or columns in trials with cherry tomatoes carried out in greenhouses and the use of border does not bring benefits in terms of reduction of coefficient of variation or reduction of cases of variance heterogeneity among rows or columns. Plots with a size equal to or greater than two plants make possible to use the completely randomized design in the cherry tomato trials in greenhouses.},

Alternative pathway glycolysis, alternative pathway respiration and malate-derived lactic and alcoholic fermentation (alternative pathway fermentation), all unique to plants, are integrated into a regulatory mechanism of pH in the cytoplasm. Its uniqueness to plant kingdom is discussed from the evolutionary viewpoint: it is suggested that when the ancestors of extant terrestrial plants expanded their habitat from oceans to freshwater, they abandoned a “sodium system” and adopted a “proton system” for nutrient uptake. Validity of the new hypothesis is examined with available data on a secondary active transport, anoxia and other experimental evidence. The hypothesis predicts that biotic and abiotic stress-induced cytoplasmic acidification triggers synthesis of phytoalexins and other secondary metabolites. Possible roles of cyanide-resistant alternative pathway respiration in the secondary metabolite production, metabolic switching between primary and secondary metabolisms, and defense reactions are proposed.},

abstract = {The concept of relative growth has independently been developed and pursued in different fields of science and at different locations. It has proved to be useful in comparative studies of plant growth analysis. The purpose of this review is to provide a synthesis of different independent approaches as well as of research applications and to standardise the mathematical notation in order to facilitate future research.

In the context of ecology, we explore and analyse the definitions of absolute and relative growth rates, growth acceleration, growth multipliers and allometry from a mathematical point of view. In addition, we evaluate statements made in the literature, compare different concepts that have been developed separately and show how they relate to each other. We also review and standardise functions of absolute and relative growth, which can be used for analysing and modelling plant growth. Finally, we comment on sampling, growth rate combinations and the recently discussed method of size standardisation.

We conclude that the different approaches to quantifying and modelling relative growth rates can conveniently be integrated in one consistent theoretical concept and as a result provide useful synergies. A harmonisation of different definitions of relative growth rate is straightforward and a consistent, meaningful notation provides a deeper understanding of the concept.

Relative growth rates are key characteristics for assessing growth performance and growth efficiency. Recently they have gained importance for diagnosing and modelling mortality and reproduction processes and they potentially play a crucial role in reconstructing growth processes in dendrochronology, climate change and forest decline research. From a technical point of view, relative growth rates are more straightforward to model than absolute growth rates and more emphasis should be devoted to model development.},

abstract = {Inorganic nitrogen concentrations in soil solutions vary across several orders of magnitude among different soils and as a result of seasonal changes. In order to respond to this heterogeneity, plants have evolved mechanisms to regulate and influx. In addition, efflux analysis using 13N has revealed that there is a co‐ordinated regulation of all component fluxes within the root, including biochemical fluxes. Physiological studies have demonstrated the presence of two high‐affinity transporter systems (HATS) for and one HATS for in roots of higher plants. By contrast, in Arabidopsis thaliana there exist seven members of the NRT2 family encoding putative HATS for and five members of the AMT1 family encoding putative HATS for . The induction of high‐affinity transport and Nrt2.1 and Nrt2.2 expression occur in response to the provision of , while down‐regulation of these genes appear to be due to the effects of glutamine. High‐affinity transport and AMT1.1 expression also appear to be subject to down‐regulation by glutamine. In addition, there is evidence that accumulated and may act post‐transcriptionally on transporter function. The present challenge is to resolve the functions of all of these genes. In Aspergillus nidulans and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii there are but two high‐affinity transporters and these appear to have undergone kinetic differentiation that permits a greater efficiency of absorption over the wide range of concentration normally found in nature. Such kinetic differentiation may also have occurred among higher plant transporters. The characterization of transporter function in higher plants is currently being inferred from patterns of gene expression in roots and shoots, as well as through studies of heterologous expression systems and knockout mutants.},

abstract = {Relatively little is known about the genetic control of agronomic traits in common wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) compared with traits that follow Mendelian segregation patterns. A doubled-haploid population was generated from the cross RL4452 × 'AC Domain' to study the inheritance of the agronomic traits: plant height, time to maturity, lodging, grain yield, test weight, and 1000-grain weight. This cross includes the genetics of 2 western Canadian wheat marketing classes. Composite interval mapping was conducted with a microsatellite linkage map, incorporating 369 loci, and phenotypic data from multiple Manitoba environments. The plant height quantitative trait loci (QTLs), QHt.crc-4B and QHt.crc-4D , mapped to the expected locations of Rht-B1 and Rht-D1 . These QTLs were responsible for most of the variation in plant height and were associated with other agronomic traits. An additional 25 agronomic QTLs were detected in the RL4452 × 'AC Domain' population beyond those associated with QHt.crc-4B and QHt.crc-4D . 'AC Domain' contributed 4 alleles for early maturity, including a major time to maturity QTL on 7D. RL4452 contributed 2 major alleles for increased grain yield at QYld.crc-2B and QYld.crc-4A , which are potential targets for marker-assisted selection. A key test weight QTL was detected on 3B and prominent 1000-grain weight QTLs were identified on 3D and 4A.

abstract = {Water deficits affect citrus physiology, yield, fruit size and quality. Citrus can respond to drought stress conditions through endogenous hormonal regulation of water status and leaf abscission. In this work, we assayed the efficiency of an amendment to soilless media in delaying the drought stress effect in young citrus seedlings and trees. Substrate amendment promoted plant survival of citrus seedlings subjected to several cycles of drought stress and rehydration. In budded trees, the amendment increased substrate water content, leaf water potential, leaf number, root biomass, CO2 assimilation and stomatal conductance over that of control plants growing in non-amended substrates. We conclude that the substrate amendment reduced the damaging effects of drought stress in citrus plants. The longer survival of seedlings in the amended treatment together with the reduction in leaf abscission and the improvement of physiological parameters, can account for a higher vigour of citrus grown under water stress conditions.},

abstract = {The availability of observed daily solar radiation (OSR) is restricted to recent years. Its estimation through different methods is necessary to develop long-term data sets for agricultural and environmental applications. The objective of this study was to analyze the impact of using generated daily solar radiation (GSR) on simulated growth and yield of cotton, maize, and peanut. Nine locations representing Georgia's major crop belt were selected. Daily weather data from the Georgia Automated Environmental Monitoring Network (AEMN), including solar radiation, maximum and minimum temperature, and precipitation, were duplicated. The OSR was removed from one set and then generated using a stochastic procedure. The Cropping System Models (CSM)-CROPGRO-Cotton, CERES-Maize, and CROPGRO-Peanut of the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) v4 were used to simulate crop growth and yield at each location with both OSR and GSR and for rainfed and irrigated conditions. The statistical analysis included summary statistics, Pearson's coefficient of correlation, mean squared deviation (MSD) and its components, namely: squared bias (SB), squared difference between standard deviations (SDSD), lack of correlation weighted by the standard deviations (LCS), and regressions. Within locations, for the three crops under rainfed and irrigated conditions, GSR did not significantly affect simulated total evapotranspiration and aboveground biomass and yields. For the three crops, deviations of simulated water use and yields from GSR with respect to simulated water use and yields from OSR were lower for the rainfed than for the irrigated conditions. Yields from the CSM-CROPGRO-Cotton and -Peanut models had lower deviations than yields from the CSM-CERES-Maize model. LCS was the major component of the MSD suggesting that the extent of the difference between standard deviations of GSR and OSRG could affect the outputs of the crop models. Nevertheless, for most locations none of the MSD components of the GSR showed significant correlation with simulated yields and the overall performance of the models was not affected. It can be concluded based on the results of this study that GSR can be used as an input for crop model simulation models when OSR is not available.},

abstract = {Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grain storage proteins (GSPs) are major determinants of flour end-use value. Biological and molecular mechanisms underlying the developmental and nutritional determination of GSP accumulation in cereals are as yet poorly understood. Here we timed the accumulation of GSPs during wheat grain maturation relative to changes in metabolite and transcript pools in different conditions of nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) availability. We found that the N/S supply ratio modulated the duration of accumulation of S–rich GSPs and the rate of accumulation of S–poor GSPs. These changes are likely to be the result of distinct relationships between N and S allocation, depending on the S content of the GSP. Most developmental and nutritional modifications in GSP synthesis correlated with the abundance of structural gene transcripts. Changes in the expression of transport and metabolism genes altered the concentrations of several free amino acids under variable conditions of N and S supply, and these amino acids seem to be essential in determining GSP expression. The comprehensive data set generated and analyzed here provides insights that will be useful in adapting fertilizer use to variable N and S supply, or for breeding new cultivars with balanced and robust GSP composition.},

abstract = {Root chicory is a potential alternative sugar crop which accumulates a high amount of linear fructose polymers (fructan) in its roots. Lengthening the growing season by early sowing may increase root chicory yield potential, and thus increase its competitiveness with traditional sugar crops. A field experiment was conducted in 1998 and 1999 on a sandy loam soil (Haplic Luvisol) at Braunschweig, Germany, to study the consequences of early sowing on emergence, bolting, yield, and quality of root chicory. In each year, the cultivars Tilda, Wixor, Hicor, Cassel, Bergues, Fredonia Nova, and Regalo were sown at three dates ranging from mid March to early May. The mean emergence rates for the early sowings in March were insufficient in 1998 (45{\%}) but adequate in 1999 (82{\%}). Averaged across years and cultivars, emergence took 25, 21, and 13 days at early, medium, and late sowing. While bolters were almost absent at medium and late sowing, average bolting percentage at early sowing amounted to 18.3{\%} in 1998 and 22.7{\%} in 1999. Each percent of bolters reduced fructose yield by 1.1{\%} in 1998, and 1.2{\%} in 1999. In 1998, the fructose yield of the most productive cultivars at early sowing (Bergues) and at medium sowing (Fredonia Nova) were not significantly different. In 1999, early sown Bergues produced a significantly higher fructose yield than any other cultivar and sowing date combination. It is concluded that increasing root chicory yield potential by early sowing is not limited by a lack of bolting-resistant cultivars, but by the risk of poor crop establishment due to unfavourable weather conditions.},

abstract = {Soybean is one of the most economically important crops in the world. Soybean seeds have abundant protein and lipid content and very high economic value. In this study, a total of 184 seed-specific genes were obtained using online microarray databases, DDD, and RNA-seq data. The reported seed-specific genes in soybean and the 184 seed-specific genes analyzed in this paper were compared. Of the screened genes, 26 were common to both previous reports and the current screening. Meanwhile, 90 of the 184 genes have homologous counterparts in Arabidopsis, among which 24 have seed-specific expression, as indicated by microarray data for Arabidopsis. Furthermore, promoter analysis showed that almost all seed-specific genes contain at least one seed specific-related element. Seed-specific element Skn-1 motif exists in most, if not all, of the seed-specific genes screened. Five genes were randomly selected from 184 soybean seed specific gene pool and their expressions were quantified using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to further confirm the specificity of the screened genes. The results indicated that all five genes showed seed-specific expression. Moreover, the identification of genes with seed-specific expression screened in this study provides information valuable to the in-depth study of soybean.},

abstract = {The weight and composition of soybean seeds (Glycine Max L. Merrill) depend on changes in carbon and nitrogen assimilate supply during grain filling. Soybean pods and seeds are green, evidencing their capacity to capture light. However, the current physiological knowledge does not consider any effect of incident solar radiation reaching the pods on seed weight and composition. The objective of this work was to investigate the response of seed weight and composition to changes in assimilate supply from leaves, to the incident solar radiation reaching the pods and to the combination of both, changes in assimilate supply from the leaves and incident solar radiation on pods of soybean plants. Field experiments were performed during two growing seasons at Balcarce, Argentina. Treatments modified the amount of assimilates supplied by the leaves (plant shading, defoliation), the solar radiation reaching the pods (pod shading) or both (defoliation and pod shading) during seed filling. Plant shading and defoliation reduced seed weight, oil concentration and oil and protein content and increased the concentration of saturated and poli-unsaturated fatty acids while reduced oleic acid percentage. Pod shading increased the concentration of stearic acid and reduced the concentration of linolenic acid. When pods were shaded on defoliated plants, seed weight and oil and protein content decreased while fatty acid composition was similar to values obtained under defoliation treatment. Based on these results, a conceptual model that considers photoheterotrophic nature of reproductive structures of soybean is proposed. Seed weight, oil and protein content and oil fatty acid composition depended on assimilate availability for the seeds. The response of oil and protein content to assimilate supply depended on whether leaves were present or not. The effect of solar radiation incident on pods depended on the amount of assimilates available for the seeds: (i) when carbon allocated was low (defoliation treatments), pods contributed to seed carbon economy but solar radiation incident on them did not affect fatty acid composition; (ii) when carbon allocated to the seeds was high (intact plants), contribution of pods to seed carbon economy was not significant, but the amount of solar radiation incident on pods produced significant changes in fatty acid composition.},

In addition, the antioxidant phenolic compounds, produced by shoots under nutritional stress or in response to exogenously added proline, have been studied. Caffeic acid, rosmarinic acid, and lithospermic acid B have been isolated in oregano shoot cultures by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, and their structures have been elucidated by tandem mass spectrometry. Both nutritional stress, which in turn causes a moderate increase of constitutive free proline, and exogenous proline affect growth and antioxidant phenolic content of oregano shoots, compared to control.

The role of proline, and the associated redox cycle, as a form of metabolic signaling based on a transfer of redox potential amongst interacting cell pathways, which in turn elicit phenolic metabolism via stimulated carbon flux through oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, is discussed. Furthermore, the potential use of oregano tissue and callus cultures as a new strategy to enable the production of useful secondary metabolites on a commercial scale is also discussed.},

abstract = {Polyploidization is an important process in the evolutionary history of most eukaryotic species. It oftentimes causes large-scale genomic reorganizations and is accompanied by a wide variety of phenotypic alterations in morphology, niche preference and fitness characteristics. Despite their importance, the morphological effects of alterations in ploidy are not well understood. We investigated these changes in four diverse maize inbred lines, using monoploid, diploid, triploid and tetraploid derivatives, measuring 13 characters in a randomized field study. Employing several analysis of variance approaches, we find that all characters investigated strongly respond to alterations in ploidy. This response appears to have two sources: one source is shared by all inbred lines and constitutes a common response to ploidy change. The other source is genotype specific and results in a response to ploidy change that varies among inbred lines. This finding demonstrates the existence of genetic variation for the morphological response to ploidy change in Zea mays.},

However, in topologically challenging cases (e.g., when two interfaces are in close contact), level set functions develop singularities that yield inaccurate curvatures when using traditional discretizations. In this note, we give an improved discretization of curvature for use near level set singularities. Where level set irregularities are detected, we use a local polynomial approximation of the interface to construct the level set function on a local subgrid, where we can accurately calculate the curvature using the standard 9-point discretization. We demonstrate that this new algorithm is capable of calculating the curvature accurately in a variety of situations where the traditional algorithm fails and provide numerical evidence that the method is second-order accurate. Examples are drawn from modified Hele-Shaw flows and a model of solid tumor growth.},

abstract = {Partitioning and translocation of 14C-photosynthates were examined during flowering and seed maturation in soybean (Glycine max [L.]Merr.) plants to quantify allocation to sugars, amino acids, organic acids, and starch and to study transport of C and N from leaves to reproductive sinks. The trifoliolate leaf at the eighth node was exposed to steady state levels of 14CO2 for 2 hours, followed by immediate extraction and identification of radioactive assimilates in the fed leaf blade, tissues of the transport path (e.g. petiole and stem), and fruits if they were present. About one-third of the total 14C recovered from the leaf blades was in starch until late pod-filling, after which the proportion dropped to 16{\%}. Sugars comprised 70{\%} to 86{\%} of the recovered 14C from soluble assimilates of the source leaf, with highest proportions occurring during late flowering and early pod-filling. Amino acids accounted for 8{\%} to 17{\%} of the 14C recovered from the soluble fraction, and were most evident during early flowering and mid to late pod-filling. The 14C-organic acids comprised from 3{\%} to 14{\%} of the soluble 14C-assimilates in leaves. Petioles consistently contained a higher percentage of recovered radioactivity in sugars (87-97{\%}) and a lower percentage in amino acids (3-12{\%}) than did leaf blades. 14C-Amino acids in petioles attained their highest levels during mid and late pod-filling, while 14C-organic acids comprised 2{\%} or less of the recovered radioactivity after pod initiation. The distribution of 14C-assimilates in the internode below the source leaf was similar to that found in petioles. A comparison of the above data to calculated C and N requirements for seed development suggests that 14C-amino acids derived from current photosynthesis and translocated from source leaves supply at least 12{\%} to 48{\%} of the seed N depending on the stage of pod-filling.},

abstract = {US maize yield has increased eight-fold in the past 80 years, with half of the gain attributed to selection by breeders. During this time, changes in maize leaf angle and size have altered plant architecture, allowing more efficient light capture as planting density has increased. Through a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of the maize nested association mapping panel, we determined the genetic basis of important leaf architecture traits and identified some of the key genes. Overall, we demonstrate that the genetic architecture of the leaf traits is dominated by small effects, with little epistasis, environmental interaction or pleiotropy. In particular, GWAS results show that variations at the liguleless genes have contributed to more upright leaves. These results demonstrate that the use of GWAS with specially designed mapping populations is effective in uncovering the basis of key agronomic traits.},

abstract = {Background Maize rough dwarf disease (MRDD) is a devastating viral disease that results in considerable yield losses worldwide. Three major strains of virus cause MRDD, including maize rough dwarf virus in Europe, Mal de R{\#}237;o Cuarto virus in South America, and rice black-streaked dwarf virus in East Asia. These viral pathogens belong to the genus fijivirus in the family Reoviridae. Resistance against MRDD is a complex trait that involves a number of quantitative trait loci (QTL). The primary approach used to minimize yield losses from these viruses is to breed and deploy resistant maize hybrids. Results Of the 50 heterogeneous inbred families (HIFs), 24 showed consistent responses to MRDD across different years and locations, in which 9 were resistant and 15 were susceptible. We performed trait-marker association analysis on the 24 HIFs and found six chromosomal regions which were putatively associated with MRDD resistance. We then conducted QTL analysis and detected a major resistance QTL, qMrdd1, on chromosome 8. By applying recombinant-derived progeny testing to self-pollinated backcrossed families, we fine-mapped the qMrdd1 locus into a 1.2-Mb region flanked by markers M103-4 and M105-3. The qMrdd1 locus acted in a recessive manner to reduce the disease-severity index (DSI) by 24.2-39.3{\%}. The genetic effect of qMrdd1 was validated using another F.sub.6 recombinant inbred line (RIL) population in which MRDD resistance was segregating and two genotypes at the qMrdd1 locus differed significantly in DSI values. Conclusions The qMrdd1 locus is a major resistance QTL, acting in a recessive manner to increase maize resistance to MRDD. We mapped qMrdd1 to a 1.2-Mb region, which will enable the introgression of qMrdd1-based resistance into elite maize hybrids and reduce MRDD-related crop losses.},

In this study, a high-grain-weight mutant line M8008 was identified from a library of mutants of the common wheat cultivar YN15 treated with ethylmethane sulfonate (EMS). F2 and F2:3 generations produced from crosses of M8008 × YN15 (MY) and M8008 × SJZ54 (MS) were used for genetic analysis. There were significant differences between M8008 and YN15 in plant height (PH), spike length (SL), fertile spikelet number per spike (FSS), grain width (GW), grain length (GL), GL/GW ratio (GLW), and thousand-grain weight (TGW). Most simple correlation coefficients were significant for the investigated traits, suggesting that the correlative mutations occurred in M8008. Approximately 21{\%} of simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers showed polymorphisms between M8008 and YN15, indicating that EMS can induce a large number of mutated loci. Twelve quantitative trait loci (QTLs) forming QTL clusters (one in MY and two in MS) were detected. The QTL clusters coinciding with (MY population) or near (MS population) the marker wmc41 were associated mainly with grain-size traits, among which the M8008 locus led to decreases in GW, factor form density (FFD), and TGW and to increases in GLW.

Azizi, Mahmoudi, and Chili were characterized by higher dough tenacity, lower dough extensibility, and a greater alveograph configuration ratio P/L. The high molecular weight glutenin subunits 6+8 (Azizi and Mahmoudi) and 7+15 (Chili), coded by the Glu-B1 locus, improved gluten strength and viscoelastic dough properties. Calculated HMW to LMW-GS ratios were within a narrow range of 0.17–0.29. Some genotypes have potential to be used as parents in breeding programs.},

This review summarizes molecular information available about the early stages of the elicitation process and the mode of action of elicitors. A description is first provided on the importance of plant secondary metabolism, its induction by elicitation, the elicitor concept and classification, factors affecting elicitation and the mechanisms involved, with a major emphasis on the intracellular transduction systems which mediate the actions of elicitors, namely, elicitor receptors, GTP binding proteins, the Ca2+ messenger system and the PI3K, PLC/IP3-DAG/PKC and adenylyl cyclase/cAMP/PKA pathways, which finally act through mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) affecting the expression of genes related to the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. Relevant experimental approaches used to study these topics are also discussed.},

abstract = {Comparative genomics is a powerful tool to decipher gene and genome evolution. Placing multiple genome comparisons in a phylogenetic context improves the sensitivity of evolutionary inferences. In the genus Oryza, this comparative approach can be used to investigate gene function, genome evolution, domestication, polyploidy, and ecological adaptation. A large genomic region surrounding the MONOCULM1 (MOC1) locus was chosen for study in 14 Oryza species, including 10 diploids and 4 allotetraploids. Sequencing and annotation of 18 bacterial artificial chromosome clones for these species revealed highly conserved gene colinearity and structure in the MOC1 region. Since the Oryza radiation about 14 Mya, differences in transposon amplification appear to be responsible for the different current sizes of the Oryza genomes. In the MOC1 region, transposons were only conserved between genomes of the same type (e.g., AA or BB). In addition to the conserved gene content, several apparent genes have been generated de novo or uniquely retained in the AA lineage. Two different 3-gene segments have been inserted into the MOC1 region of O. coarctata (KK) or O. sativa by unknown mechanism(s). Large and apparently noncoding sequences flanking the MOC1 gene were observed to be under strong purifying selection. The allotetraploids Oryza alta and Oryza minuta were found to be products of recent polyploidization, less than 1.6 and 0.4 Mya, respectively. In allotetraploids, pseudogenization of duplicated genes was common, caused by large deletions, small frame-shifting insertions/deletions, or nonsense mutations.},

As 20E is inducible in spinach, the defensive role against plant-parasitic nematodes was investigated. The effects of direct application on nematodes was assessed by treating cereal cyst nematode, Heterodera avenae, juveniles with concentrations of 20E from 8.2 × 10−8 to 5.2 × 10−5 M before applying to Triticum aestivum growing in sand. H. avenae, Heterodera schachtii (sugarbeet cyst nematode), Meloidogyne javanica (root-knot nematode) and Pratylenchus neglectus (root lesion nematode) were treated with 5.2 × 10−5 20E and incubated in moist sand. To test the protective effects of 20E in plants, the latter three nematodes were applied to Spinacia oleracea in which elevated concentrations of 20E had been induced by methyl jasmonate. Abnormal molting, immobility, reduced invasion, impaired development, and death occurred in nematodes exposed to 20E either directly at concentration above 4.2 × 10−7 M or in plants. Phytoecdysteroid was found to protect spinach from plant-parasitic nematodes and may confer a mechanism for nematode resistance.},

Nitrogen remobilization and post-anthesis nitrogen uptake in relation to elevated grain protein concentration in durum wheat. Can. J. Plant Sci. 91: 273–282. Grain protein concentration is an important end-use suitability factor in durum wheat [Triticum turgidum L. ssp. durum (Desf.) Husn.] through its effect on cooking quality. Genetic differences in grain protein concentration are exploited in Canadian durum breeding programs, but the physiological basis of these differences remains unknown. Eighteen durum genotypes varying in grain protein concentration were grown at three pre-selected Saskatchewan locations that differ for soil nitrogen (N). These included check cultivars and six low- and six high-protein doubled haploid (DH) selections from the cross DT695×Strongfield (low- by high-protein). Plants were sampled at the anthesis, milk, dough and physiological maturity developmental stages, and dry matter and N concentration of plant parts were determined. The high-protein selections expressed 0.6 to 1.1 percentage units higher grain protein concentration than the low selections over the three environments (P{\{}{\textless}{\}}0.05), but yielded less grain than the low selections in two of the three environments. Remobilization of N from vegetative organs to grain varied with environment and accounted for 73 to 98{\%} of grain N, the remainder made up from post-anthesis N uptake. The high-protein selections showed greater post-anthesis N uptake than the low selections in two of three environments (P{\{}{\textless}{\}}0.01), but lower N remobilization from vegetative organs to the grain than the low selections in the same environments (P{\{}{\textless}{\}}0.05). Subtle differences in N and dry matter partitioning accounted for the observed differences in grain protein concentration.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina. All rightd reserved. Different sources and nitrogen management (N) may increase the availability, absorption, and assimilation of this nutrient by plants, favoring the N accumulation in grains. However, little is known about the influence of these factors on the physiological quality of wheat seeds (Triticum aestivum L.). In this context, the aim of this study was to evaluate the response of different sources and nitrogen fertilization, applied in cover, on the physiological quality of the wheat seeds. The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized block design in a split-design treatment plot with three cultivars of wheat (TBIO Mestre, TBIO Igua{\c{c}}u and Quartzo), three sources of nitrogen (urea, ammonium nitrate, and liquid urea), applied using five methods: (I: tilling; II: tilling and booting; III: tilling and flowering; IV: booting and flowering and V: tilling, booting and flowering). The nitrogen partitioning between booting and flowering stages results in higher physiological seed quality, since it increases the percentage of germination by 4{\%} and positively influences the germination count, shoot length, and seedling dry mass. The sources of nitrogen ammonia nitrate and the urea liquid source are equated with urea in relation to the effect on the physiological quality of the seeds, being interesting alternatives to reduce the production cost. The TBIO Mestre and Quartzo cultivars showed seeds with higher physiological quality, due to the greater length of radicle and percentage of germination.},

@article{tollenaar_yield_2002-2,
abstract = {Average commercial maize yield in the US has increased from about 1 Mg/ha in the 1930s to about 7 Mg/ha in the 1990s. Although the increase has been the result of both genetic and agronomic-management improvements, we contend that most of this improvement is the result of the genotype×management interaction. The genetic improvement in maize yield is associated neither with yield potential per se, nor with heterosis per se, but it is associated with increased stress tolerance, which is consistent with the improvement in the genotype×management interaction. The potential for future yield improvement through increased stress tolerance of maize in the US is large, as yield potential is approximately three times greater than current commercial maize yields. The mechanism by which maize breeders have improved stress tolerance is not known, but we speculate that increased stress tolerance may have resulted from the selection for yield stability. Stability analyses were performed on a number of high-yielding maize hybrids, including three hybrids that have been involved in some of the highest maize yields recorded in producers' fields, to examine the relationship between yield and yield stability. Results of the stability analyses showed that high-yielding maize hybrids can differ in yield stability, but results do not support the contention that yield stability and high grain yield are mutually exclusive.},

When natural lead compounds have been discovered and when chemical synthesis cannot be easily performed, the extraction and purification of biomolecules from entire plants is generally the preferred solution. However, it is now established that plant cells and tissue cultures in bioreactors can constitute an alternative solution to this agronomical approach. Our research programs devoted to the production of tropane alkaloids from Datura innoxia and furanocoumarins from Ruta graveolens have shown that hydroponics and aeroponics, techniques situated in-between field and fermentor scales, enable the entire plants to be used as efficient bioreactors. Revisiting scientific advances made in the past decades, the ethical, legal, biological and technological aspects are discussed in the light of the most recent literature, in order to establish a roadmap for further developments of plant secondary metabolite production systems.},

Results revealed that artemisinin, arteannuin-B, artemisinic acid, dihydroartemisinic acid and essential oil content were positively controlled by the growth and development however negatively modulated by water deficit stress. Interestingly, some of minor monoterpenes, all sesquiterpenes and other low molecular weight volatiles of essential oil components were induced by water deficit treatment. Camphor which is the major essential oil constituents did not alter much while 1, 8 cineole was modulated during development of plant as well as under water stress conditions. Water deficit stress induces a decrease in glandular trichome density and size as well. The dynamics of various secondary metabolites is discussed in the light of growth responses, trichomes and pathway gene expression in plants grown under two levels of prolonged water stress conditions.},

abstract = {According to some estimates, a 70{\%} increase in crop yield could be achieved if the environmental conditions were close to the optimum ones for a given plant, which is why the identification and control of adverse environmental effects is a top priority in many countries worldwide. This paper contains a discussion of the changes in selected elements of the secondary metabolism in the leaves of two grapevine varieties (Vitis vinifera L.) with a different degree of tolerance to cold stress during prolonged and constant low temperature stress. The analyses have shown that the more-tolerant variety was characterized by a higher content of phenolic compounds, better radical-scavenging capacity and stronger reducing power. However, the cold stress caused a decrease in the concentration of the phenolics and decreased the scavenging capacity in the leaves of both varieties. Four phenolic acids have been identified in the extracts from the leaves of both grapevines: caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid and a caffeic acid derivative. Caffeic acid appeared in the highest concentrations in all the leaf extracts. Additionally, it has been noted that in the leaves of the varieties susceptible and tolerant to cold stress, the prolonged exposure to low temperature caused a considerable reduction of the content of all identified phenolic acids. The results of the analyses have demonstrated large differences in the functioning of the secondary metabolism in response to the same stressor.},

abstract = {Eleven field experiments were conducted in Yongshou County, Shanxi Province and seven in Luoyang, Henan Province, and five layers of soil were sampled in 20-cm increments to 100 cm depth for each experimental field to study the difference of wheat (Triticum aestivum) responses to nitrate and ammonium nitrogen (N) and the relation of its responses to nitrate N cumulative amount in different soil layers. In Yongshou, each experimental site included seven treatments (control, two varieties of nitrate N, two varieties of ammonium N, and two combinations of ammonium to nitrate N in a ratio of 1:2) while in Luoyang, six treatments (only one variety of nitrate N). Total 150 kg ha−1 N was added as basal for N fertilization treatments at wheat seeding time. Results showed that differences in two varieties of each N form or combinations were much less than those of N forms. As a whole, wheat responses to nitrate N were better in most cases and in few cases, there was no significant difference between nitrate N and ammonium N on wheat yield. Using averages of yield, yield increase amount (kg ha−1) and percentage ({\%}) of different N forms for comparison, nitrate N was highest in yield and yield increase, followed by the combination, while the ammonium N was lowest. The lower the amount of accumulated nitrate N in the soil profile, the better the nitrate N superiority. Our finding was that the superiority of nitrate N over ammonium N on wheat yield depended on the accumulative nitrate amounts in soil, and only in soil having low cumulative nitrate N amount at the rooting depth, did the nitrate N show its superiority over the ammonium N. In contrast, if the accumulative nitrate N amount was high, the two N forms had no significant difference on wheat yield.},

More than one response variable can be analyzed simultaneously, and these variables are allowed to follow Gaussian, Poisson, multi(bi)nominal, exponential, zero-inflated and censored distributions. A range of variance structures are permitted for the random effects, including interactions with categorical or continuous variables (i.e., random regression), and more complicated variance structures that arise through shared ancestry, either through a pedigree or through a phylogeny. Missing values are permitted in the response variable(s) and data can be known up to some level of measurement error as in meta-analysis.

abstract = {Providing food and other products to a growing human population while safeguarding natural ecosystems and the provision of their services is a significant scientific, social and political challenge. With food demand likely to double over the next four decades, anthropization is already driving climate change and is the principal force behind species extinction, among other environmental impacts. The sustainable intensification of production on current agricultural lands has been suggested as a key solution to the competition for land between agriculture and natural ecosystems. However, few investigations have shown the extent to which these lands can meet projected demands while considering biophysical constraints. Here we investigate the improved use of existing agricultural lands and present insights into avoiding future competition for land. We focus on Brazil, a country projected to experience the largest increase in agricultural production over the next four decades and the richest nation in terrestrial carbon and biodiversity. Using various models and climatic datasets, we produced the first estimate of the carrying capacity of Brazil's 115 million hectares of cultivated pasturelands. We then investigated if the improved use of cultivated pasturelands would free enough land for the expansion of meat, crops, wood and biofuel, respecting biophysical constraints (i.e., terrain, climate) and including climate change impacts. We found that the current productivity of Brazilian cultivated pasturelands is 32–34{\%} of its potential and that increasing productivity to 49–52{\%} of the potential would suffice to meet demands for meat, crops, wood products and biofuels until at least 2040, without further conversion of natural ecosystems. As a result up to 14.3 Gt CO2 Eq could be mitigated. The fact that the country poised to undergo the largest expansion of agricultural production over the coming decades can do so without further conversion of natural habitats provokes the question whether the same can be true in other regional contexts and, ultimately, at the global scale.},

At Feeke's growth stage 8 (last leaf just visible), 100 micromoles of 99 atom{\%} 15N-ammonium was injected into the lower MS. At anthesis, MS sink size was adjusted by removal of 0, 33, 66, and 100{\%} of the MS spikelets; tiller spikes were left intact. The MS and tiller average kernel size was unaffected by MS sink manipulations. The MS kernel N concentration increased when MS spikelets were removed. Tiller kernel N concentrations were unaffected except when the entire MS reproductive sink was removed, which caused an increase in tiller kernel N concentration. Net losses of MS vegetative N during grain fill were similar for all treatments except for plants lacking MS spikelets, which mobilized 30{\%} less N from the MS. Labeled N was predominately ({\{}{\textgreater}{\}}90{\%}) associated with the insoluble reduced N fraction of plant tissues at anthesis. Allocation of labeled N to tillers was not proportional to reduction in MS sink size. These results indicate that the reproductive sink on an individual culm has first priority for vegetative N mobilized during grain fill even when sink demand is reduced substantially.},

abstract = {An increase in mean and extreme summer temperatures is expected as a consequence of climate changes and this might have an impact on plant development in numerous species. Root chicory (Cichorium intybus L.) is a major crop in northern Europe, and it is cultivated as a source of inulin. This polysaccharide is stored in the tap root during the first growing season when the plant grows as a leafy rosette, whereas bolting and flowering occur in the second year after winter vernalisation. The impact of heat stress on plant phenology, water status, photosynthesis-related parameters, and inulin content was studied in the field and under controlled phytotron conditions. In the field, plants of the Crescendo cultivar were cultivated under a closed plastic-panelled greenhouse to investigate heat-stress conditions, while the control plants were shielded with a similar, but open, structure. In the phytotrons, the Crescendo and Fredonia cultivars were exposed to high temperatures (35 °C day/28 °C night) and compared to control conditions (17 °C) over 10 weeks. In the field, heat reduced the root weight, the inulin content of the root and its degree of polymerisation in non-bolting plants. Flowering was observed in 12{\%} of the heat stressed plants during the first growing season in the field. In the phytotron, the heat stress increased the total number of leaves per plant, but reduced the mean leaf area. Photosynthesis efficiency was increased in these plants, whereas osmotic potential was decreased. High temperature was also found to induced flowering of up to 50{\%} of these plants, especially for the Fredonia cultivar. In conclusion, high temperatures induced a reduction in the growth of root chicory, although photosynthesis is not affected. Flowering was also induced, which indicates that high temperatures can partly substitute for the vernalisation requirement for the flowering of root chicory.},

abstract = {Jasmonates are essential phytohormones for plant development and survival. However, the molecular details of their signalling pathway remain largely unknown. The identification more than a decade ago of COI1 as an F-box protein suggested the existence of a repressor of jasmonate responses that is targeted by the SCFCOI1 complex for proteasome degradation in response to jasmonate. Here we report the identification of JASMONATE-INSENSITIVE 3 (JAI3) and a family of related proteins named JAZ (jasmonate ZIM-domain), in Arabidopsis thaliana. Our results demonstrate that JAI3 and other JAZs are direct targets of the SCFCOI1 E3 ubiquitin ligase and jasmonate treatment induces their proteasome degradation. Moreover, JAI3 negatively regulates the key transcriptional activator of jasmonate responses, MYC2. The JAZ family therefore represents the molecular link between the two previously known steps in the jasmonate pathway. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of a regulatory feed-back loop involving MYC2 and JAZ proteins, which provides a mechanistic explanation for the pulsed response to jasmonate and the subsequent desensitization of the cell.},

Vertical resin duct formation started 12 weeks after cambial reactivation with the first duct in each tree, except two, forming at the early-wood. Resin flow, an important factor in pine resistance to bark beetle attack, was moderately correlated with vertical duct density, growth variables, and all measured environmental variables with total soilwater storage, cumulative water deficit, and maximum air temperature combined accounting for 73{\%} of the variation.

Amino nitrogen and total nitrogen changed seasonally with peak concentrations coinciding with cell initiation and active growth, leaf fall, and winter cold temperatures. Seasonal change in resin flow was associated with changes in physiology related to ontogeny as well as environment. Knowledge of such relationships improves the basis for future study of pine/bark beetle interactions.},

abstract = {Food resources of the modern world are strained due to the increasing population. There is an urgent need for innovative methods and approaches to augment food production. Legume seeds are major resources of human food and animal feed with their unique nutrient compositions including oil, protein, carbohydrates, and other beneficial nutrients. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) together with “omics” technologies have considerably strengthened soybean research. The availability of well annotated soybean genome sequence along with hundreds of identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with different seed traits can be used for gene discovery and molecular marker development for breeding applications. Despite the remarkable progress in these technologies, the analysis and mining of existing seed genomics data are still challenging due to the complexity of genetic inheritance, metabolic partitioning, and developmental regulations. Integration of “omics tools” is an effective strategy to discover key regulators of various seed traits. In this review, recent advances in “omics” approaches and their use in soybean seed trait investigations are presented along with the available databases and technological platforms and their applicability in the improvement of soybean. This article also highlights the use of modern breeding approaches, such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS), genomic selection (GS), and marker-assisted recurrent selection (MARS) for developing superior cultivars. A catalog of available important resources for major seed composition traits, such as seed oil, protein, carbohydrates, and yield traits are provided to improve the knowledge base and future utilization of this information in the soybean crop improvement programs.},

The data were subjected to modern statistical tools like Additive Main effects and Multiplicative Interaction (AMMI) model and the Genotype main effects and Genotype × Environment Interaction effects (GGE) model and Cluster Analysis. The IPCA-I was attributed 58.53{\%} and 80.36{\%} Genotype × Environment (G × E) variation of fruit weight and fruit yield per plant, respectively. The cumulative contribution of IPCA-I and IPCA-II to the total G × E variance was 95.72{\%} for number of fruits per plant, 91.02{\%} for anthocyanin in peel, 87.0{\%} for total phenols and 93.42{\%} for DPPH Free Radical Scavenging Capacity (DPPHFRSC). Significant residual interaction values demonstrated the presence of a considerable noise for total phenols and DPPHFRSC. AMMI-I biplot indicated that Lal Kuli, Samrat, Mala, Muktamala, Lamba Kuli, Mukta Hasi, Muktazuri and Heera could be recommended for general cultivation in both spring-summer and autumn-winter to achieve optimum yields. The autumn-winter and spring-summer seasons were emerged as two different mega-environments. Cluster analysis revealed the high percentage of similarity between Muktamala and Muktazuri and the diverse nature of Panna, Makra Midlong and KS-8103 in terms of response to the environment.},

The objective of this work was to evaluate the consistency of the methods of Annicchiarico, Lin {\&} Binns, Wricke, and factor analysis in identifying eucalyptus clones with stability, adaptability, and high productive potential. Eight-four clones, with three years of age, from the genetic breeding program of the company CMPC Celulose Riograndense were used. Three field experiments were carried out in a randomized complete block design, in an 84x3 factorial arragement, with 20 replicates of one plant per plot. The clones were evaluated as to diameter at breast height, plant height, and volume of wood. The methods of Annicchiarico and Lin {\&} Binns are highly correlated with each other, and their use together with the method of Wricke is a sound strategy for the evaluation of eucalyptus clones. The factor analysis identified broadly adaptable clones, and some of them were the same ones identified by the methods of Annicchiarico and Lin {\&} Binns. The use of the mean classification of the clones, along with the factor analysis, is efficient to identify the most adapted, stable, and productive ones among a high number of genotypes.},

abstract = {A measure of cultivar general superiority for cultivar × location data is defined as the distance mean square between the cultivar's response and the maximum response averaged over all locations. Since the maximum response is the upper boundary in each location, a small mean square indicates general superiority of the test cultivar. The method requires that all test cultivars be balanced over locations but not necessarily the checks. The advantage of the proposed method are: (i) The checks provide only a plausible maximum response for each location and are not required for assessing the test cultivars. Thus checks do not have to be present in all locations. This allows a greater flexibility for a breeder to choose locally adapted cultivars as checks without unduly increasing the size of a regional trial. (ii) The measure of general superiority consists of only one parameter, thus simplifying the screening process considerably. A subsidiary parameter for interaction can be used to indicate lack of general ...},

The adsorption was almost unchanged in the presence of maltose (2.5–20 mM) but was hindered in the presence of excess protein, suggesting non-specific adsorption of $\alpha$-amylase to cellulose. Kinetic analyses of $\alpha$-amylase hydrolysis of maize starch in the presence of cellulose showed that the inhibition is of a mixed type. The dissociation constant (Kic) of the EI complex was found to be ca. 3 mg/mL. The observed inhibition of $\alpha$-amylase activity suggests that cellulose in the diet can potentially attenuate starch hydrolysis.},

NH4+N content in the 0–40 cm soil layer increased with N application rates at overwintering and booting stages due to basal and topdressing N application, then after rapidly declined to its initial level. NO3−N content in the 0–60 cm soil layer increased as the basal N rate increased before jointing and also increased with an increase of the topdressing N dose after jointing. NO3−N mainly accumulated in the 40–60 cm soil layer at jointing stage, which inferred that NO3−N leached significantly to deep layer soil before jointing. At maturity, NO3−N accumulated mainly in the 0–40 cm soil layer due to topdressing after jointing. In all treatments, the soil apparent N surplus (ANS) differed at different growth stages. Throughout growth duration, ANS increased as the N rate and basal N ratio increased, which was mainly related to a large N surplus before jointing stage. N utilization efficiency and grain yield increased at the appropriate N rate and topdressing N ratio. Data from two growth seasons showed that the N rate to 210 kg hm−2, with half applied as topdressing, improved grain yield, plant N uptake and N utilization efficiency, and reduced leaching loss of N fertilizer.},

Plant growth parameters (shoot fresh weight, root dry weight, leaf number, node number) were measured. EO yield increased 70{\%} in P. fluorescens-inoculated and co-inoculated plants in comparison with control (non-inoculated) plants, without altering EO composition. The biosynthesis of the major EO components was increased in the inoculated plants. Shoot fresh weight and EO yield were significantly higher in P. fluorescens-inoculated and in co-inoculated plants than in control plants. The total phenolic content was 2-fold higher in singly-inoculated or co-inoculated treatments than in controls. In view of the economic importance of monoterpenes and phenolic compounds for a variety of applications in the food and cosmetic industries, P. fluorescens and other PGPR have clear potential for improving the productivity of cultivated aromatic plants.

abstract = {The grain filling rate is closely associated with final grain yield of maize during the period of maize grain filling. To identify the key microRNAs (miRNAs) and miRNA-dependent gene regulation networks of grain filling in maize, a deep-sequencing technique was used to research the dynamic expression patternsof miRNAs at four distinct developmental grain filling stages in Zhengdan 958, which is an elite hybrid and cultivated widely in China. The sequencing result showed that the expression amount of almost all miRNAs was changing with the development of the grain filling and formed in seven groups. After normalization, 77 conserved miRNAs and 74 novel miRNAs were co-detected in these four samples. Eighty-one out of 162 targets of the conserved miRNAs belonged to transcriptional regulation (81, 50{\%}), followed by oxidoreductase activity (18, 11{\%}), signal transduction (16, 10{\%}) and development (15, 9{\%}). The result showed that miRNA 156, 393, 396 and 397, with their respective targets, might play key roles in the grain filling rate by regulating maize growth, development and environment stress response. The result also offered novel insights into the dynamic change of miRNAs during the developing process of maize kernels and assistedin the understanding of how miRNAs are functioning about the grain filling rate.},

They remained a bit of a mystery to other groups, and have now largely fallen into disuse. In this primer, Li gives the best description available of path coefficients and their uses. It is intended for the beginner (the first 100 pages are on simple and multiple regression and correlation) and derives the material in great detail and with much repetition. However, as the author points out, redundancy usually helps the novice to understand relationships better. As a primer, it gives rules and procedures for simple cases, rather than showing general results, or applications to practical problems, or dealing with complications - such as interactions, scale effects or selection. There are 110 pages on population genetics, seeking to interpret its basic results to bio-social scientists. Here it is concerned with details, rather than principles, and may well add to their confusion.Essentially, path coefficients are standardised partial regression coefficients. Path analysis seeks to assign a causal directional model of effects among a series of variables, based on some biological interpretation. However, the model is usually arbitrary, and the path coefficients derived are entirely model-dependent.There are many difficulties in path coefficients that are not considered by Li (because his book is a primer?). There is no discussion of sampling errors of the path coefficients. The analyses are deterministic rather than testing goodness of fit or hypotheses. The methods cannot deal readily with interactions among variables or with selection, and they become very complex when many variables are included. They have largely become outdated by the generality and power of the standard multivariate analysis techniques. The merit in path coefficients may lie in the path diagrams, which help the biologist picture the various causes and interrelationships possible in a complex situation with many variates. A recent use by Rao and Morton [Animal Breeding Abstracts 43, 3176], should be mentioned, in which Wright's path coefficients are integrated with Fisher's tests of hypotheses in analysing familial relationships in man.Li's primer is unlikely to lead to a widespread re-use of path coefficients, but it gives a useful account for anyone interested in their origins and mystery.Charles Smith},

abstract = {Organisms are regularly subjected to abiotic stressors related to increasing anthropogenic activities, including chemicals and climatic changes that induce major stresses. Based on various key taxa involved in ecosystem functioning (photosynthetic microorganisms, plants, invertebrates), we review how organisms respond and adapt to chemical- and temperature-induced stresses from molecular to population level. Using field-realistic studies, our integrative analysis aims to compare i) how molecular and physiological mechanisms related to protection, repair and energy allocation can impact life history traits of stressed organisms, and ii) to what extent trait responses influence individual and population responses. Common response mechanisms are evident at molecular and cellular scales but become rather difficult to define at higher levels due to evolutionary distance and environmental complexity. We provide new insights into the understanding of the impact of molecular and cellular responses on individual and population dynamics and assess the potential related effects on communities and ecosystem functioning.},

abstract = {* 1The biases and shortcomings of stepwise multiple regression are well established within the statistical literature. However, an examination of papers published in 2004 by three leading ecological and behavioural journals suggested that the use of this technique remains widespread: of 65 papers in which a multiple regression approach was used, 57{\%} of studies used a stepwise procedure.
* 2The principal drawbacks of stepwise multiple regression include bias in parameter estimation, inconsistencies among model selection algorithms, an inherent (but often overlooked) problem of multiple hypothesis testing, and an inappropriate focus or reliance on a single best model. We discuss each of these issues with examples.
* 3We use a worked example of data on yellowhammer distribution collected over 4 years to highlight the pitfalls of stepwise regression. We show that stepwise regression allows models containing significant predictors to be obtained from each year's data. In spite of the significance of the selected models, they vary substantially between years and suggest patterns that are at odds with those determined by analysing the full, 4-year data set.
* 4An information theoretic (IT) analysis of the yellowhammer data set illustrates why the varying outcomes of stepwise analyses arise. In particular, the IT approach identifies large numbers of competing models that could describe the data equally well, showing that no one model should be relied upon for inference.},

abstract = {Outliers can have a considerable influence on the conventional measure of covariance, which may lead to a misleading understanding of the comovement between two variables. Both an analytical derivation and Monte Carlo simulations show that the conventional measure of covariance can be heavily influenced in the presence of outliers. This paper proposes an intuitively appealing and easily computable robust measure of covariance based on the median and compares it with some existing robust covariance estimators in the statistics literature. It is demonstrated by simulations that all of the robust measures are fairly stable and insensitive to outliers. We apply robust covariance measures to construct two well-known portfolios, the minimum-variance portfolio and the optimal risky portfolio. The results of an out-of-sample experiment indicate that a potentially large investment gain can be realized using robust measures in place of the conventional measure.},

abstract = {l-2,4-diaminobutyric acid was studied as an inhibitor of gamma-aminobutyric acid uptake by a synaptosomal fraction isolated from rat brain. Competitive inhibition was observed during short-term exposure of the synaptosomal fraction to the inhibitor but noncompetitive inhibition was observed following prolonged exposure. Studies on the mode of action of l-2,4-diaminobutyric acid showed that the synaptosomal fraction was capable of accumulating this compound and that both the uptake and the effectiveness of the inhibitor were sodium-dependent and temperature-sensitive. In addition, the degree of inhibition of gamma-aminobutyric acid uptake was related to the amount of l-2,4-diaminobutyric acid accumulated. It is suggested that the observed noncompetitive inhibition of gamma-aminobutyric acid uptake by l-2,4-diaminobutyric acid is a result of the accumulation of the inhibitor which exerts its effect from within the synaptosomes. Raising the external concentration of gamma-aminobutyric acid to saturating levels did not completely inhibit the accumulation of l-2,4-diaminobutyric acid. Thus, the transport of l-2,4-diaminobutyric acid appears to be mediated, at least in part, by a carrier which is not involved in the transport of gamma-amiuobutyric acid.},

The experiment was carried out at the Laboratory of Plant Breeding and Production, Federal University of Santa Maria, Campus of Frederico Westphalen - RS. Seed samples were collected from 14 black oat populations from small producers in the region, and cultivars BRS Madrugada and BRS Centauro (populations 15 and 16, respectively). A randomized block design with four replications was used. It was evaluated seed length, seed width, thousand seed weight, percentage of germination, non-germinated seeds, abnormal seedlings, hypocotyl length, root length, dry matter of seedlings. Populations revealed a difference in the physiological quality of seeds, and populations 1, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, with germination within the required standard, have a greater potential to compose progenies. Seed width, thousand seed weight, dry matter of seedlings and hypocotyl length revealed association with germination. It is worth highlighting that seed width and thousand seed weight are characters of easy and immediate measurement that can guarantee greater efficiency of selection.},

A basal diet was supplemented with SI at 0, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80 mg kg−1 feed for 8 weeks. Significantly maximum weight gain (WG) and specific growth rate (SGR) were observed in treatment with 40 mg kg−1 SI supplement (P {\textless} 0.05). Feed conversion ratio (FCR), feeding rate (FR) and survival rate were not significantly different among treatments. Fish fed a diet with 40 mg kg−1 SI showed significant increase in plasma total protein content, complement 3 content, lysozyme activity as well as respiratory burst activity, but decrease in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activities (P {\textless} 0.05). Increased plasma alkaline phosphatase activity, hepatic total antioxidative capacity, catalase activity and superoxide dismutase activity were also noticed in fish fed SI at 40 or 60 mg kg−1 (P {\textless} 0.05). On the contrary, the lowest hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) content was observed in fish fed SI at 40 mg kg−1 (P {\textless} 0.05). Compared with the control, the relative level of HSP70 mRNA in fish fed SI at 40–80 mg kg−1 were significantly increased, respectively (P {\textless} 0.05). After challenge with V. harveyi, significant higher post-challenge survival was observed in fish fed diets with 40–80 mg kg−1 SI supplement than that in control group (P {\textless} 0.05). These results indicated that dietary intake containing SI could enhance the immune ability of fish and improve its resistance to infection by V. harveyi.

abstract = {Carob seedlings were grown hydroponically for 9 weeks under 360 and 800 $\mu$l l-1CO2. One of two nitrogen sources, nitrate or ammonium, was added to the nutrient medium at concentrations of 3 mol m-3. Root systems of the developing plants supplied with nitrate compared to those supplied with ammonium were characterized by:(a)more biomass on the lower part of the root;(b)fewer lateral roots of first and second order;(c)longer roots;(d)higher specific root length;(e)a smaller root diameter. The morphology of the root systems of nitrate-fed plants changed in the presence of elevated carbon dioxide concentrations, resembling, more closely, that of ammonium-fed plants. Total leaf area was higher in ammonium- than in nitrate-fed plants. Nitrate-fed plants had greater total leaf area in the presence of high carbon dioxide than in normal CO2, due to an increase in epidermal cell size that led to development of larger leaflets with lower stomatal frequency. The observed changes in the morphology of roots and shoots agreed with the results observed for total biomass production. Nitrate-fed plants increased their biomass production by 100{\%} in the presence of elevated CO2compared to 15{\%} in ammonium-fed plants, indicating that the response of carob to high CO2concentrations is very dependent on the nitrogen source. Under elevated CO2, nitrate-grown plants had a larger content of sucrose in both roots and shoots, while no significant difference was observed in the content of sucrose in ammonium-grown plants, whether in ambient or enriched carbon dioxide. Hence, the differences in soluble carbohydrate contents can, at least partly, account for differences in root and shoot morphology.Copyright 1997 Annals of Botany Company},

Nitrate can be accumulated within rice tissues and reused when N supply is insufficient. We compared the remobilization of NO−3 stored in the tissue and vacuolar between two rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars, Yangdao 6 (YD6, indica) with a high N use efficiency (NUE) and Wuyujing 3 (WYJ3, japonica) with a low NUE and measured the uptake of NO−3, expression of nitrate reductase (NR), NO−3 transporter genes (NRTs), and NR activity after 4 d of N starvation following 7-d cultivation in a solution containing 2.86 mmol L−1 NO−3. The results showed that both tissue NO−3 concentration and vacuolar NO−3 activity were higher in YD6 than WYJ3 under N starvation. YD6 showed a 2- to 3-fold higher expression of OsNRT2.1 in roots on the 1st and 4th day of N starvation and had significantly higher values of NO−3 uptake (maximum uptake velocity, Vmax) than the cultivar WYJ3. Furthermore, YD6 had significantly higher leaf and root maximum NR activity (NRAmax) and actual NR activity (NRAact) as well as stronger root expression of the two NR genes after the 1st day of N starvation. There were no significant differences in NRAmax and NRAact between the two rice cultivars on the 4th day of N starvation. The results suggested that YD6 had stronger NRA under N starvation, which might result in better NO−3 re-utilization from the vacuole, and higher capacity for NO−3 uptake and use, potentially explaining the higher NUE of YD6 compared with WYJ3.},

abstract = {Complex quantitative traits of plants as measured on collections of genotypes across multiple environments are the outcome of processes that depend in intricate ways on genotype and environment simultaneously. For a better understanding of the genetic architecture of such traits as observed across environments, genotype-by-environment interaction should be modeled with statistical models that use explicit information on genotypes and environments. The modeling approach we propose explains genotype-by-environment interaction by differential quantitative trait locus (QTL) expression in relation to environmental variables. We analyzed grain yield and grain moisture for an experimental data set composed of 976 F(5) maize testcross progenies evaluated across 12 environments in the U.S. corn belt during 1994 and 1995. The strategy we used was based on mixed models and started with a phenotypic analysis of multi-environment data, modeling genotype-by-environment interactions and associated genetic correlations between environments, while taking into account intraenvironmental error structures. The phenotypic mixed models were then extended to QTL models via the incorporation of marker information as genotypic covariables. A majority of the detected QTL showed significant QTL-by-environment interactions (QEI). The QEI were further analyzed by including environmental covariates into the mixed model. Most QEI could be understood as differential QTL expression conditional on longitude or year, both consequences of temperature differences during critical stages of the growth.},

The treatments were set as: CK (W1W1N1), T1 (W2W1N1), T2 (W1W2N1), T3 (W2W2N1), T4 (W2W1N2), T5 (W1W2N2), T6 (W2W2N2) and T7 (W1W1N2). The results indicated that the fruit yields under deficit irrigation were reduced by 8.6–12.5{\%} and 13.1–29.4{\%} in the two seasons, respectively. The contents of TTS (total soluble solids), TSSC (total soluble sugar content), SAR (sugar and organic acid content ratio), VC (vitamin C), lycopene, and RS (reducing sugar) in the fruits of all the plants increased during the maturation in the WS season. Crop evapotranspiration (ETc), contents of TTS, TSSC, SAR and VC were all increased in the treated fruits compared to the control ones (CK) in both seasons. According to the two-way ANOVA, the fruit quality was more sensitive to water than to N-fertilizer, but it was just the opposite for NC (nitrate content). GRA (gray relational analysis method) and PCA (principal component analysis method) were two suitable appraisement methods for fruit comprehensive quality analysis. Eventually, the combinational evaluation method showed that T3 (W2W2N1) was the best water and nitrogen management strategy for the fruit comprehensive quality and yields in tomato.},

Two uniformity trials were performed with eggplant in a plastic tunnel. The fresh fruit weight and the total number of fruits were assessed in each basic unit and in each harvest. The harvests were analyzed individually and grouped. Heterogeneity was found among crop rows and individual harvests within the same row. However, when the harvests were grouped, this fact was not observed. When the harvests are grouped, there was a reduction in plot size and sample needed the grouping of six harvests presented the smallest sample size and plot size. The plot size is five plants, the sample is nine plants in the direction of the crop row with a half-range of the 20{\%} confidence interval. Aiming at achieving a minimum-significant difference in the Tukey's test of 30{\%} of treatment mean, three replications with five plants each plot is needed.},

abstract = {This chapter explains the regulatory aspects of the expression of genes for proteins synthesized during development and germination. It reviews the synthesis of some important classes of storage proteins during seed development, and discusses the cessation of protein synthesis during maturation drying and the revival of synthesis during germination, leading to seedling establishment. Gene expression during germination has been studied to a far lesser extent, for unlike in development, there are no proteins synthesized in large amount. Post-germinative physiology, involving the mobilization of stored reserves to provide for seeding growth, requires the expression of genes for hydrolytic enzymes. Studies on this subject, especially in relation to the synthesis of $\alpha$-amylase in the aleurone layer of the cereal endosperm, remain a major part of this aspect of seed biology. During development, an endosperm is formed from a triploid fusion nucleus. The endosperm may or may not persist in the mature seed, but when present, it usually is the tissue in which the stored reserves are deposited; otherwise, the cotyledons are the major store. In seeds of monocotyledonous plants (e.g., cereals), the embryo contains an axial region, but the cotyledon is modified to form a relatively diminutive scutellum; the endosperm is a large structure at maturity, and is the important storage tissue.},

We developed a physical map of 4.98 Gb, with more than 3.90 Gb anchored to a high-resolution genetic map. Projecting a deep whole-genome shotgun assembly, complementary DNA and deep RNA sequence data onto this framework supports 79,379 transcript clusters, including 26,159 'high-confidence' genes with homology support from other plant genomes. Abundant alternative splicing, premature termination codons and novel transcriptionally active regions suggest that post-transcriptional processing forms an important regulatory layer. Survey sequences from diverse accessions reveal a landscape of extensive single-nucleotide variation.

Treated samples were stored at 1 °C and 90{\%} RH for 20 d. Results revealed increases in specific and total activity of PAL during cold storage. Among phenolics, 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid and protocatechuic acid ethyl ester were identified by HPLC–DAD–ESI-MS. Increases in acids 4-hydroxybenzoic, 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic, syringic and vanillic agreed with PAL activity increases, whereas in ellagic were largely independent on PAL. Increases in protocatechuic acid and decreases in protocatechuic acid ethyl ester exhibited no direct relation to PAL.},

abstract = {In the last five years, sharp increases in the price of natural resins, accompanied by technological advances directed toward mechanization, have made resin tapping a strategic activity for rural development and forest conservation. The resin industry demands more efficient tapping methods and forest management plans as a way to increase competitiveness in a global market. Understanding the effects of environmental conditions on resin yield, especially under the current scenario of climate change, is key to improving techniques and plans in the resin industry. This study aims to evaluate the intra- and inter-annual effects of climate conditions and soil water availability on resin yield in tapped Pinus pinaster stands. The individual resin yield of 26 tapped trees growing at two locations with different stand densities and soil characteristics was measured fortnightly during the tapping season (June to October) for four years. The study was complemented with an analysis of changes in xylem anatomy over the four years, with a focus on axial resin canal traits, including 12 non-tapped trees as controls. Intra-annual variation in resin yield was strongly correlated with temperature, solar radiation, potential evapotranspiration and water deficit. Inter-annual variation in resin yield and resin canal abundance were correlated with temperature and water deficit in spring, but above a certain threshold of cumulated water deficit in summer rainfall favored resin yield. Under adverse climate scenarios where resource optimization is desirable, a reduced tapping season during the warmest months (June–September) would be advisable, assuming a very small production loss. Similarly, in years with a rainy summer and/or dry spring, a slightly longer tapping season could be suggested, as resin yield increases after these events.},

abstract = {Wheat grain storage protein (GSP) content and composition are the main determinants of the end-use value of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grain. The accumulation of glutenins and gliadins, the two main classes of GSP in wheat, is believed to be mainly controlled at the transcriptional level through a network of transcription factors. This regulation network could lead to stable cross-environment allometric scaling relationships between the quantity of GSP classes/subunits and the total quantity of nitrogen per grain. This work conducted a genetic mapping study of GSP content and composition and allometric scaling parameters of grain N allocation using a bread wheat worldwide core collection grown in three environments. The core collection was genotyped with 873 markers for genome-wide association and 167 single nucleotide polymorphism markers in 51 candidate genes for candidate association. The candidate genes included 35 transcription factors (TFs) expressed in grain. This work identified 74 loci associated with 38 variables, of which 19 were candidate genes or were tightly linked with candidate genes. Besides structural GSP genes, several loci putatively trans-regulating GSP accumulation were identified. Seven candidate TFs, including four wheat orthologues of barley TFs that control hordein gene expression, were associated or in strong linkage disequilibrium with markers associated with the composition or quantity of glutenin or gliadin, or allometric grain N allocation parameters, confirming the importance of the transcriptional control of GSP accumulation. Genome-wide association results suggest that the genes regulating glutenin and gliadin compositions are mostly distinct from each other and operate differently.},

abstract = {Characterization of nearly 1,000 cultivated potato accessions with simple sequence repeats (SSRs; also referred to as microsatellites) has allowed the identification of a reference set of SSR markers for accurate and efficient genotyping. In addition, 31 SSRs are reported here for a potato genetic map, including new map locations for 24 of them. A first criterion for this proposed reference set was ubiquity of the SSRs in the eight landrace cultivar groups of the potato, Solanum tuberosum. All SSRs tested in the present study displayed the same allele phenotypes and allele size range in the diverse germplasm set as in the advanced potato cultivar germplasm in which they were originally discovered. Thirteen of 13 SSR products from all cultivar groups are shown to cross-hybridize with the corresponding SSR product of the source cultivar to ascertain sequence homology. Other important SSR selection criteria are quality of amplification products, locus complexity, polymorphic index content, and well-dispersed location on a potato genetic map. Screening of 156 SSRs allowed the identification of a highly informative and user-friendly set comprising 18 SSR markers for use in characterization of potato genetic resources. In addition, we have identified true- and pseudo-multiplexing SSRs for even greater efficiency.},

The analysis of variance revealed the significant differences among the genotypes for all the traits indicating presence of sufficient variability among the genotypes for various traits. The high GCV and PCV were observed for grain yield per plant, number of effective tillers per plant, spike length and 1000 grain weight indicated wider genetic variation for these traits. The high heritability combined with high genetic advance as per cent of mean was observed for grain yield per plant indicated that selection may be effective for this character. The results of correlation studies indicated that genotypic correlation coefficients were higher in magnitude than their corresponding phenotypic correlation coefficients for most of the traits. Grain yield per plant had significant and positive correlation with grain filling period, effective tillers per plant and 1000 grain weight at both genotypic and phenotypic levels indicating that these three traits were main yield attributing traits. The path analysis indicated that effective tillers per plant had maximum direct effect on grain yield followed by grain filling period and 1000 grain weight should be given for yield improvement in durum wheat.},

@article{machingura_-cyanoalanine_2013-1,
abstract = {The $\beta$-cyanoalanine pathway is primarily responsible for detoxification of excess cyanide produced by plants. Recent evidence suggests that cyanide detoxification via this pathway may be involved in the response and tolerance to water deficit in plants. The aim of this study was to explore this role in Arabidopsis thaliana in greater detail. The first objective was to establish responsiveness of the pathway to the magnitude and duration of water deficit. The second objective was to examine how interruption of single genes (AtCysA1, AtCysC1 and AtNIT4) encoding enzymes of the pathway influenced the ability to metabolize cyanide and withstand water deficit. Arabidopsis plants were exposed to conditions which emulated acute and chronic water deficit, followed by measurement of tissue cyanide concentration, activity of enzymes, and physiological parameters. The results for wild-type Arabidopsis demonstrated a transient increase in cyanide concentration and $\beta$-cyanoalanine synthase activity, followed by a decrease in both. The increase in enzyme activity was localized to the tissue in direct proximity to the stress. The knockdown AtCysA1 mutant did not differ from wild-type while AtCysC1 mutants were slightly more sensitive to water deficit. The AtNIT4 mutant was the most sensitive showing decreased growth along with altered chlorophyll content under water deficit as compared to wild-type. Collectively, the results indicated that the pathway is responsive to water deficit although the severity of stress did not alter the nature of the response, implying that the capacity to remove cyanide generated during water deficit may contribute to tolerance to this stress in Arabidopsis.},

Results indicated that more DNA sequences from paternal diploid species were eliminated in the synthetic hexaploid wheat than from maternal tetraploid wheat, suggesting that genome from parental species of lower ploidity tends to be eliminated preferentially. However, sequence variation detected by SSCP procedure was much lower than those detected by DNA-AFLP, which indicated that much less variation in the genic regions occurred in the synthetic hexaploid wheat, and sequence variations detected by DNA-AFLP could be derived mostly from non-coding regions and repetitive sequences. Our results also indicated that sequence variation in 4 genes can be detected in hybrid F1, which suggested that this type of sequence variation could be resulted from distant hybridization. It was interesting to note that 3 out of the 4 genes were mapped and clustered on the long arm of chromosome 2D, which indicated that variation in genic sequences in synthetic hexaploid wheat might not be a randomized process.},

Three types panels were produced using 11-9{\%} urea-formaldehyde adhesive (core and surface, respectively), with 650 kg/m3 target density, 150 °C pressing temperature, 20-24 kg/cm2 pressure, and 6 min of pressing time. The analyses revealed that use of ammonium nitrate for particleboard manufacturing resulted in improved water absorption and thickness swelling properties after 24 h of immersion in water. In addition, the using ammonium nitrate has no significant effect by Modulus of rupture (MOR) and modulus of elasticity (MOE). However, internal bond strength, screw withdrawal resistance and surface durability properties were positively affected by using ammonium nitrate. Formaldehyde content value was decreased by about 5{\%}. The study demonstrated that the boards made of ammonium nitrate meet the requirements for general standard and building materials.},

abstract = {For aggregated or heterogeneous disease incidence, one can predict the proportion of sampling units diseased at a higher scale (e.g., plants) based on the proportion of diseased individuals and heterogeneity of diseased individuals at a lower scale (e.g., leaves) using a function derived from the beta-binomial distribution. Here, a simple approximation for the beta-binomial-based function is derived. This approximation has a functional form based on the binomial distribution, but with the number of individuals per sampling unit (n) replaced by a parameter (v) that has similar interpretation as, but is not the same as, the effective sample size (ndeff ) often used in survey sampling. The value of v is inversely related to the degree of heterogeneity of disease and generally is intermediate between ndeff and n in magnitude. The choice of v was determined iteratively by finding a parameter value that allowed the zero term (probability that a sampling unit is disease free) of the binomial distribution to equal the zero term of the beta-binomial. The approximation function was successfully tested on observations of Eutypa dieback of grapes collected over several years and with simulated data. Unlike the beta-binomial-based function, the approximation can be rearranged to predict incidence at the lower scale from observed incidence data at the higher scale, making group sampling for heterogeneous data a more practical proposition.},

A trend of improving yield and adaptation was observed. As highly significant genotype × site interaction each year was not adequately described using regression analysis, yield stability was examined by ranking genotypes within sites and summarizing scores for individual genotypes across sites. Cluster analysis was used to study the relationships among sites and among genotypes. There was little evidence of sites grouping on a geographical basis. Grouping of genotypes showed a tendency for complete and substituted triticales to perform differently, suggesting that diversity for adaptation is maximized by utilizing both types in breeding. Progress for grain yield is compared with more spectacular gains in test weight and reasons for the different rates of improvement are postulated. {\textcopyright} 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

Temperatures of 20-26°C from sowing to emergence proved most suitable for emergence. Faster growth of seedlings in the following 5-10 weeks was also observed. Moreover, temperatures of about 20°C during emergence proved sufficiently high to reduce the incidence of bolting, and increased marketable yield. These effects on bolting and yield were more evident after early transplanting. A strong reduction in bolting was also observed by delaying transplanting, but this was at the expense of early production. Postponing transplanting improved the number of leaves per plant and the average weight of the heads. Exposure of the seeds to 0°C for two weeks prior to sowing allowed faster emergence of seedlings compared with that of seedlings of seeds exposed to 20, 30 and 40°C. Low temperature also influenced the subsequent development of the plants, favouring their growth in the first three months of the cycle.},

abstract = {Tillering ability is one of the most important traits of the rice plant because it plays a major role in determining grain yield. However, it is not clear whether rice yield potential could be further increased if unproductive tillers were reduced or eliminated. Two field experiments were conducted to determine the effects of tiller reduction on plant growth and grain yield in two varieties with different tillering ability. Two methods were used to reduce tillers: the first was the removal of tillers manually at different crop growth stages and the second was to grow rice plants through holes in styrofoam slats, which provided a physical restriction on tiller emergence. Tiller number declined by 12–57{\%} with the first method and by 18–47{\%} with the second method compared with the control. Despite the significant reduction in tiller number and unproductive tiller percentage, none of the treatments with manual tiller removal and physical restriction of tillering resulted in a significant increase in grain yield compared with the control. Decreases in leaf area and biomass at heading and panicle number at maturity were observed when tiller number declined significantly, but grain yield was not necessarily reduced because it was compensated for by more biomass production after heading and increased spikelet number per panicle. The two varieties with different tillering ability had similar responses to tiller reduction. Based on the two methods of tiller reduction used in this study, we conclude that a further increase in rice yield potential may not be possible by reducing or eliminating unproductive tillers.},

abstract = {Hidden populations, such as injection drug users and sex workers, are central to a number of public health problems. However, because of the nature of these groups, it is difficult to collect accurate information about them, and this difficulty complicates disease prevention efforts. A recently developed statistical approach called respondent-driven sampling improves our ability to study hidden populations by allowing researchers to make unbiased estimates of the prevalence of certain traits in these populations. Yet, not enough is known about the sample-to-sample variability of these prevalence estimates. In this paper, we present a bootstrap method for constructing confidence intervals around respondent-driven sampling estimates and demonstrate in simulations that it outperforms the naive method currently in use. We also use simulations and real data to estimate the design effects for respondent-driven sampling in a number of situations. We conclude with practical advice about the power calculations that are needed to determine the appropriate sample size for a study using respondent-driven sampling. In general, we recommend a sample size twice as large as would be needed under simple random sampling.},

Here, we report the stable accumulation of seed storage proteins containing disease vaccine peptides in transgenic soybean seeds. To synthesize vaccine peptides in soybean seeds, we used seed storage proteins as a carrier and a soybean breeding line lacking major seed storage proteins as a host. Vaccine peptides were inserted into the flexible disordered regions in the A1aB1b subunit three-dimensional structure. The A1aB1b subunit containing vaccine peptides in the disordered regions were sorted to the protein storage vacuoles where vaccine peptides are partially cleaved by proteases. In contrast, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-retention type of the A1aB1b subunit containing vaccine peptides accumulated in compartments that originated from the ER as an intact pro-form. These results indicate that the ER may be an organelle suitable for the stable accumulation of bioactive peptides using seed storage proteins as carriers.},

The study was conducted in an augmented randomized complete block design with three replications. Yield and its components were recorded. Correlation coefficient analysis showed that tuber yield had significant positive associations with number of tubers per plant, average weight per tuber (tuber size), plant height, diameter of main stem, and number of main and secondary stems per plant, whereas its correlation with tuber dry-matter concentration was significantly negative. Number of tubers per plant, tuber size, and plant height had significant standardized partial regression coefficients with very small tolerance and large variance inflation factor (VIF) values.

In this work, principal component analysis was used to reduce the number of predictors for calculating genomic breeding values (GEBV). Bulls of 2 cattle breeds farmed in Italy (634 Brown and 469 Simmental) were genotyped with the 54K Illumina beadchip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). After data editing, 37,254 and 40,179 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were retained for Brown and Simmental, respectively. Principal component analysis carried out on the SNP genotype matrix extracted 2,257 and 3,596 new variables in the 2 breeds, respectively. Bulls were sorted by birth year to create reference and prediction populations. The effect of principal components on deregressed proofs in reference animals was estimated with a BLUP model. Results were compared with those obtained by using SNP genotypes as predictors with either the BLUP or Bayes{\_}A method. Traits considered were milk, fat, and protein yields, fat and protein percentages, and somatic cell score. The GEBV were obtained for prediction population by blending direct genomic prediction and pedigree indexes. No substantial differences were observed in squared correlations between GEBV and EBV in prediction animals between the 3 methods in the 2 breeds. The principal component analysis method allowed for a reduction of about 90{\%} in the number of independent variables when predicting direct genomic values, with a substantial decrease in calculation time and without loss of accuracy.},

abstract = {Studies suggest that consumption of berry fruits, including strawberries (Fragaria ? ananassa Duch.), may have beneficial effects against oxidative stress mediated diseases such as cancer. Berries contain multiple phenolic compounds, which are thought to contribute to their biological properties. Comprehensive profiling of phenolics from strawberries was previously reported using high-performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) detection. The current study reports the isolation and structural characterization of 10 phenolic compounds from strawberry extracts using a combination of Amberlite XAD16-resin and C18 columns, HPLC-UV, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy methods. The phenolics were cyanidin-3-glucoside (1), pelargonidin (2), pelargonidin-3-glucoside (3), pelargonidin-3-rutinoside (4), kaempferol (5), quercetin (6), kaempferol-3-(6?-coumaroyl)glucoside) (7), 3,4,5-trihydroxyphenyl-acrylic acid (8), glucose ester of (E)-p-coumaric acid (9), and ellagic acid (10). Strawberry crude extracts and purified compounds 1?10 were evaluated for antioxidant and human cancer cell antiproliferative activities by the Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and luminescent ATP cell viability assays, respectively. Among the pure compounds, the anthocyanins 1 (7156 µM Trolox/mg), 2 (4922 µM Trolox/mg), and 4 (5514 µM Trolox/mg) were the most potent antioxidants. Crude extracts (250 µg/mL) and pure compounds (100 µg/mL) inhibited the growth of human oral (CAL-27, KB), colon (HT29, HCT-116), and prostate (LNCaP, DU145) cancer cells with different sensitivities observed between cell lines.

abstract = {The quality of wheat flour is largely determined by the properties of gluten proteins. Chemical components that influence gluten proteins are used as flour improvers in the flour industry. In this study, tannins which are natural occurring polyphenols were found to improve dough mixing properties. The effects of tannins on the physicochemical and structural properties of gluten proteins were examined, and the results showed that tannins promoted the non-covalent interactions among gluten proteins, although they induced SH/SS interchange reactions in the dough. The $\beta$-turn and $\alpha$-helix conformations were increased, whereas the $\beta$-sheet conformation was decreased in dough containing tannins as detected by FTIR. Moreover, the addition of tannins promoted the aggregation of gluten proteins, modified the microstructure of gluten networks, and improved the mixing properties. The positive effects of tannins on dough properties implied the potential of tannins as a new flour improver.},

abstract = {Studies were conducted to identify the existence of diurnal rhythms in sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) activity in leaves of three soybean (Glycine max L. [Merr.]) and two tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) cultivars and the effect of photoperiod (15 versus 7 hours) on carbohydrate partitioning and the rhythm in enzyme activity. Acclimation of all the genotypes tested to a short day (7 hours) photoperiod resulted in increased rates of starch accumulation, whereas rates of translocation, foliar sucrose concentrations, and activities of SPS were decreased relative to plants acclimated to long days (15 hours). Under the long day photoperiod, two of the three soybean cultivars (`Ransom' and `Jupiter') and one of the two tobacco cultivars (`22NF') studied exhibited a significant diurnal rhythm in SPS activity. With the soybean cultivars, acclimation to short days reduced the activity of SPS (leaf fresh weight basis) and tended to dampen the amplitude of the rhythm. With the tobacco cultivars, photoperiod affected the shape of the SPS-activity rhythm. The mean values for SPS activity (calculated from observations made during the light period) were correlated positively with translocation rates and were correlated negatively with starch accumulation rates. Overall, the results support the postulate that SPS activity is closely associated with starch/sucrose levels in leaves, and that acclimation to changes in photoperiod may be associated with changes in the activity of SPS.},

abstract = {Carbon assimilation, translocation, and associated biochemical characteristics of the second trifoliolate leaf (numbered acropetally) of chamber-grown soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merr., plants were studied at selected stages of leaf development during the period from 10 to 25 days postemergence. Leaves of uniform age were selected on the basis of leaf plastochron index (LPI).
The test leaf reached full expansion (Amax) and maximum CO2 exchange rates on a leaf area basis at 17 days postemergence (LPI 4.1). Maximum carbon exchange rates per unit dry weight of lamina were attained several days earlier and declined as specific leaf weight increased. Chlorophyll and soluble protein continued to increase beyond the attainment of Amax, but were not accompanied by further increases in photosynthetic rates.
Much of the fixed carbon in leaves is partitioned between starch and sucrose. Starch content of leaves as a percentage of dry weight at the end of an 11-hour photoperiod was taken as an indication of the potential energy reserve accumulated by the leaf. Starch levels were the same regardless of leaf age during the period from 0.3 Amax to 7 days after attaining Amax. Respiratory and synthetic activity of leaves decreased considerably during the same period, suggesting that starch accumulation is not entirely controlled by the energy demands of the leaf.
Sucrose content increased steadily during leaf expansion and was accompanied by corresponding increases in sucrose phosphate synthetase (EC 2.4.1.14) activity and translocation rates. Sucrose phosphate synthetase may have an important regulatory role in photosynthate partitioning and translocation.},

abstract = {Rice, one of the world's most important food plants, has important syntenic relationships with the other cereal species and is a model plant for the grasses. Here we present a map-based, finished quality sequence that covers 95{\%} of the 389 Mb genome, including virtually all of the euchromatin and two complete centromeres. A total of 37,544 non-transposable-element-related protein-coding genes were identified, of which 71{\%} had a putative homologue in Arabidopsis. In a reciprocal analysis, 90{\%} of the Arabidopsis proteins had a putative homologue in the predicted rice proteome. Twenty-nine per cent of the 37,544 predicted genes appear in clustered gene families. The number and classes of transposable elements found in the rice genome are consistent with the expansion of syntenic regions in the maize and sorghum genomes. We find evidence for widespread and recurrent gene transfer from the organelles to the nuclear chromosomes. The map-based sequence has proven useful for the identification of genes underlying agronomic traits. The additional single-nucleotide polymorphisms and simple sequence repeats identified in our study should accelerate improvements in rice production.},

@article{pennypacker_environmental_1999,
abstract = {ABSTRACT The sporadic occurrence of Sclerotinia stem rot in soybeans often is attributed to the sensitivity of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum to environmental factors. Environmental sensitivity in soybean response to the pathogen also could contribute to the unpredictable nature of this disease. We used stability analysis to determine whether soybean cultivar response to S. sclerotiorum was sensitive to light and temperature. Five greenhouse experiments examined the response of seven cultivars to limited-term inoculation with S. sclerotiorum. The cultivars, selected at random from Pennsylvania variety trials, represented maturity groups grown in Pennsylvania and other states sharing that latitude. Photon flux density of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and temperature were recorded hourly and varied among experiments. Environmental sensitivity was detected in the response of five cultivars to S. sclerotiorum when individual cultivar disease ratings (assessed 6 days after inoculation) were regressed against the mean disease rating of each experiment. Stability analysis with temperature during the 48-h inoculation period as the environmental index found that all cultivars responded similarly to the number of hours that temperatures were {\{}{\textless}{\}}19 degrees C, 19 to 22 degrees C, or {\{}{\textgreater}{\}}22 degrees C. In contrast, cultivars separated into PAR-sensitive and PAR-insensitive groups when the environmental index was moles of PAR at a photon flux density {\{}{\textgreater}{\}}/=475 mumol m(-2) s(-1) during the inoculation period. The photon flux density of PAR on a cloudy day in the field is {\{}{\textless}{\}}/=200 mumol m(-2) s(-1). The two cultivar groups were identical to those identified as environmentally sensitive and insensitive in the initial analysis. The PAR-sensitive cultivars had homogeneous negative regression coefficients different (P = 0.001) from zero. As the accumulated moles of PAR during the inoculation period increased, the disease ratings of the PAR-sensitive cultivars decreased; the disease ratings of the PAR-insensitive cultivars remained stable. The photon flux density of PAR during the 48-h inoculation period explained the environmental sensitivity of soybean cultivar response to S. sclerotiorum in these experiments.},

Tree height was measured from 2007 to 2014 on 18 trees for each of the following species: Eucalyptus urophylla × Eucalyptus grandis, Parapiptadenia rigida, Peltophorum dubium, Mimosa scabrella and Schizolobium parahybae. Different existing nonlinear models were fitted to the observed data, and the best fitting models were selected. The inclusion of climatic variables into the selected models (mainly minimum temperature and rainfall) improved their predictions of tree height growth with age, and provided more accurate estimates than those obtained by traditional nonlinear models. Simulations were carried out to explore the variation of tree height growth under different minimum temperature and precipitation regimes. The effects of frost and rainfall variation on height growth curves and their consequences for forest management are discussed.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel knowledge-and-data-driven modeling (KDDM) approach for simulating plant growth that consists of two submodels. One submodel is derived from all available domain knowledge, including all known relationships from physically based or mechanistic models; the other is constructed solely from data without using any domain knowledge. In this work, a GreenLab model was adopted as the knowledge-driven (KD) submodel and the radial basis function network (RBFN) as the data-driven (DD) submodel. A tomato crop was taken as a case study on plant growth modeling. Tomato growth data sets from twelve greenhouse experiments over five years were used to calibrate and test the model. In comparison with the existing knowledge-driven model (KDM, BIC = 1215.67) and data-driven model (DDM, BIC = 1150.86), the proposed KDDM approach (BIC = 1144.36) presented several benefits in predicting tomato yields. In particular, the KDDM approach is able to provide strong predictions of yields from different types of organs, including leaves, stems, and fruits, even when observational data on the organs are unavailable. The case study confirms that the KDDM approach inherits advantages from both the KDM and DDM approaches. Two cases of superposition and composition coupling operators in the KDDM approach are also discussed.},

abstract = {In order to study the association among yield components and their direct and indirect effects on the grain yield, 144 experimental maize hybrids in Kermanshah, Iran were evaluated in a lattice design with two replications. Analysis of variance, factor and sequential path analyses were carried out for the studied traits. Results of path analysis showed that two first-order variables, namely; 100 grain weight (100-GW) and total number of kernels per ear (TNK) revealed highest direct effects on total grain weight (TGW), while ear length (EL), ear diameter (ED), number of kernel rows (NR) and number of kernels per row (NKR) were found to fit as second-order variables. Multivariate factorial analyses showed that six independent factors justified 77.852{\%} of total data variations. The first and third justifications that explain 33.155{\%} of the data variation was called yield and yield components. The second factor (14.121{\%}) called traits was related to kernel depth. Other factors were phenology (11.060{\%}), plant growth (11.038{\%}) and tassel (8.478{\%}). We concluded that hybrid number 69 (860002-2) has the highest grain yield. The traits 100 GW and TNK were shown to be the two important factors that affected the maize performance. Moreover, NKR showed the highest direct effect on TNK which showed the highest direct effect on TGW. Therefore, NKR could be used as a suitable index to improve grain yield too.

abstract = {One of the greatest challenges in crop science worldwide is to generate a balance between crop production and environmental preservation. Agroforestry systems present promising strategies for balancing environmental health and crop production. The aim of this study was to evaluate yield components and the juice quality of five sugarcane crop years cultivated in the understory of Aleurites fordii , in two intercropping systems and a monocropping system. A field experiment was conducted from November 2011 to June 2016 in the city of Frederico Westphalen—Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Information generated in this study confirms the viability of the cultivation of sugarcane in agroforestry systems, and provides information for farmers which can be used to assist in the planning of more ideal agroforestry arrangements. Agroforestry systems should consider the benefits of both forest and cultivated plant species. In this study, A. fordii trees had greater growth in the intercrop II system; however, this system promoted reductions in sugarcane yield components due to the lowest relative amount of solar radiation intercepted by sugarcane plants. For sugarcane production, the use of an intercropping system with 12 × 12 m 2 arrangements should be prioritized, because it promotes greater sugarcane yields when compared with 6 × 6 m 2 intercropping systems; however, significant differences were not observed when the system (12 × 12 m 2 ) was compared with the monocropping system for most of the analyzed variables. This study sought to provide new sustainable alternatives for farmers in order to increase the diversification of rural properties and maintain the preservation of existing agroecosystems.},

abstract = {In grape cultivation, high night temperature generally reduces anthocyanin accumulation in berry skin. To clarify the regulatory mechanism of anthocyanin biosynthesis under the conditions of high night temperatures, we examined flavonoid accumulation, the activities of related enzymes and gene expression in the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway in grape berries grown under cool and warm night conditions. Anthocyanin accumulation in the skin of berries grown at high night temperatures (30 °C continuous) was reduced as compared to that of berries grown at low night temperatures (30 °C in daytime/15 °C in night time). On the other hand, flavonol levels in the skin of berries were not significantly different between low and high night temperature conditions. High night temperatures also inhibited the gene expression of chalcone synthase (CHS), flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H), dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR), leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase (LDOX) and UDP-glucose: flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase (UFGT) at veraison and an increase in UFGT activity after veraison. These results suggest that the inhibition of anthocyanin biosynthesis in grape berries grown under high night temperature condition could be caused by lower expression levels of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes at an early stage of ripening and lower activities of anthocyanin biosynthetic enzymes, particularly UFGT.},

In many cases, there is no means of achieving the superficially appealing goal of "correcting" or "controlling for" real group differences on a potential covariate. In hopes of curtailing misuse of ANCOVA and promoting appropriate use, a nontechnical discussion is provided, emphasizing a substantive confound rarely articulated in textbooks and other general presentations, to complement the mathematical critiques already available.

While the functions of auxin receptor genes have been widely studied in Arabidopsis thaliana, there has been no report on the consequences of TIR1 overexpression in plants that regulate fruit development. Here a putative tomato auxin receptor gene, homologous to Arabidopsis AtTIR1, is reported. This gene, designated as Solanum lycopersicum TIR1 (SlTIR1), was found to be expressed in all the parts of floral buds and flowers at anthesis stages. From bud to anthesis, SlTIR1 expression increases slightly in sepal tissue and decreases dramatically in stamen. From anthesis to post-anthesis when fruit set is expected to occur, the expression of SlTIR1 declines in the ovary and sepal. Overexpression of SlTIR1 results in a pleiotropic phenotype including parthenocarpic fruit formation and leaf morphology. Furthermore, SlTIR1 overexpression altered transcript levels of a number of auxin-responsive genes. The present data demonstrate that the tomato SlTIR1 gene plays an important role at the stages of flower-to-fruit transition and leaf formation.},

@article{kondhare_pre-maturity_2015-2,
abstract = {The occurrence of pre-maturity $\alpha$-amylase (PMA) is a major cause of poor bread-making quality (low Hagberg Falling Number) in wheat grain. In susceptible genotypes, it involves the excessive accumulation of high isoelectric point (pI) $\alpha$-amylase in mature grain prior to germination and in the absence of pre-harvest sprouting. Several factors regulate PMA formation in developing grain, including genotype, agronomy, and environmental conditions. In particular, a cold period during mid-grain development has been found to be a major stimulus for PMA induction. Although the factors affecting the PMA occurrence are well known, little is known about the molecular mechanism governing its induction. The plant hormones abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellins (GAs) influence various aspects of grain development, and it has been suggested that PMA involves changes in the amount of these hormones or the sensitivity of the grain to these hormones. This review summarizes recent studies investigating the role of ABA and GAs in PMA induction and PMA occurrence.},

Bioactive constituents from fruits and vegetables, such as carotenoids, folic acid and dietary fiber appear to play important roles in the prevention of these diseases. Carotenoids and their derivatives are versatile isoprenoids and play a vital role in plants and animals, starting from cellular antioxidant to gene regulation and so their importance at cellular and molecular level is well established. The most significant aspect of carotenoids in our diet is the antioxidant and provitamin A activity, and also the color that they impart to our food. The composition and bioavailability of carotenoids in food are significantly influenced by processing and other post-harvest technologies. This review discusses the theoretical aspects and recent developments in structural properties, biosynthesis and enhancement, processing, methods of analysis, composition in fruits and vegetables, and bioaccessibility and bioavailability of carotenoids.

abstract = {It is traditionally assumed that barley has a higher tillering capacity than wheat whatever the environmental condition; however, this supposition has not been formally tested under experimental conditions nor analyzed its relationship with leaf appearance. In the present work, leaf appearance and tillering dynamics were studied in wheat and barley genotypes grown under contrasting nitrogen and sulfur levels at sowing. There was no difference in phenology (seedling emergence, first visible node and flowering) between wheat and barley or due to different nutrients. Phyllochron in barley tended to be higher than (or at least equal to) that observed in wheat, without effect of the N or S levels on this trait. Differences in final leaf number were negligible. Tillering dynamics was analyzed considering the tillering appearance rate (TAR), the maximum number of tillers appeared (MTN), the tillering mortality rate (TMR), and the final number of tillers per plant (FTN). TAR was significantly greater in barley than in wheat genotypes in all experiments. In both species, TAR was enhanced as N supply was increased while S promoted TAR only under high N conditions. The MTN was positively and significantly associated with TAR. Although cessation of tillering was similar between both species, the maximum number of tillers was superior in barley than in wheat, due to the differences between species in tiller appearance rate. A high MTN was related to a high tiller mortality rate. In spite of that counterbalance, FTN was closely related to MTN; as a consequence, FTN was pre-defined during the early phase of the tillering process. Barley showed higher values of tiller initiated per leaf appeared (synchrony) than wheat, while N and S deficiencies decreased that synchrony.},

Recombinant UGT72E3/E2 chimeras, generated by exchanging parts of the C-terminal domain including the Putative Secondary Plant Glycosyltransferase (PSPG) motif of UGT72E3 and UGT72E2, were expressed in leaves of transgenic Arabidopsis plants; syringin production was measured in vivo and by enzymatic assays in vitro. In both tests, UGT72E3/2 displayed substrate specificity for sinapyl alcohol like the parental enzyme UGT72E3, and the syringin production was significantly increased compared to UGT72E3. In particular, in the in vitro assay, which was performed in the presence of a high concentration of sinapyl alcohol, the production of syringin by UGT72E3/2 was 4-fold higher than by UGT72E3. Furthermore, to enhance metabolic flow through the phenylpropanoid pathway and maintain a high basal concentration of sinapyl alcohol in the leaves, UGT72E3/2 was combined with the sinapyl alcohol synthesis pathway gene F5H encoding ferulate 5-hydroxylase and the lignin biosynthesis transcriptional activator MYB58. The resulting UGT72E3/2+F5H+MYB58 OE plants, which simultaneously overexpress these three genes, accumulated a 56-fold higher level of syringin in their leaves than wild-type plants.},

abstract = {Corn and rice genetic linkage map alignments were extended and refined by the addition of 262 new, reciprocally mapped maize cDNA loci. Twenty chromosomal rearrangements were identified in maize relative to rice and these included telomeric fusions between rice linkage groups, nested insertion of rice linkage groups, intrachromosomal inversions, and a nonreciprocal translocation. Maize genome evolution was inferred relative to other species within the Panicoideae and a progenitor maize genome with eight linkage groups was proposed. Conservation of composite linkage groups indicates that the tetrasomic state arose during maize evolution either from duplication of one progenitor corn genome (autoploidy) or from a cross between species that shared the composite linkages observed in modern maize (alloploidy). New evidence of a quadruplicated homeologous segment on maize chromosomes 2 and 10, and 3 and 4, corresponded to the internally duplicated region on rice chromosomes 11 and 12 and suggested that this duplication in the rice genome predated the divergence of the Panicoideae and Oryzoideae subfamilies. Charting of the macroevolutionary steps leading to the modern maize genome clarifies the interpretation of intercladal comparative maps and facilitates alignments and genomic cross-referencing of genes and phenotypes among grass family members.},

Statistics textbooks and the simulation literature provide several alternatives to Pearson's correlation. However, the relative performance of these alternatives has been unclear. Two simulation studies were conducted to compare 12 methods, including Pearson, Spearman's rank-order, transformation, and resampling approaches. With most sample sizes (n ≥ 20), Type I and Type II error rates were minimized by transforming the data to a normal shape prior to assessing the Pearson correlation. Among transformation approaches, a general purpose rank-based inverse normal transformation (i.e., transformation to rankit scores) was most beneficial. However, when samples were both small (n ≤ 10) and extremely nonnormal, the permutation test often outperformed other alternatives, including various bootstrap tests.},

Endopolyploidy is thought to play significant roles in physiology and development through cellular, metabolic, and genetic effects. While the occurrence of endopolyploidy has been observed widely across taxa, studies have only recently begun to characterize and manipulate endopolyploidy with a focus on its ecological and evolutionary importance. No compilation of these examples implicating endoreduplication as a generalized response to stress has thus far been made, despite the growing evidence supporting this notion. We review here the recent literature of stress-induced endopolyploidy and suggest that plants employ endoreduplication as an adaptive, plastic response to mitigate the effects of stress.},

abstract = {Safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) is a salt-tolerant crop cultivated worldwide. However, little information is available on their tolerance mechanism. Owing to decreasing arable land, cultivation of safflower in saline environments might be needed in order to promote crop biomass and secondary metabolites production. The physiological response of the selected species should be examined in order to improve environmental options, especially facing salinity stress. A hydroponic culture experiment was designed to investigate the changes in fundamental physiological processes and secondary metabolite accumulation induced by salinity in safflower (Cv. Space-1). Safflower seedlings were grown in half-strength Hoagland solution and exposed to 0, 50, 100 and 150 mM NaCl for 30 days. NaCl concentrations {\textless}100 mM did not affect the growth of safflower seedlings in terms of plant height, root length and plant dry weight, as well as the relative growth rate; however, it did increase the medicinal flavonoid content in leaves. Although the Na+ concentration was considerably increased under salt stress, higher K+ and Ca2+ concentrations in the leaves and shoots were observed simultaneously. The K+/Na+ ratio was significantly decreased with increasing salinity, whereas NaCl treatments all had K+/Na+ values {\textgreater}0.5, suggesting ion homeostasis. Chl-a and Chl-b contents in safflower leaves were negatively affected by salinity, whereas the carotenoid contents remained unchanged with NaCl concentrations {\textless}100 mM. Additionally, SOD, CAT, POD and T-AOC activities in safflower leaves were markedly increased for all of the NaCl treatments. The soluble sugar and protein contents in safflower leaves under salt stress were much higher than the control and increased significantly with increasing salinity. The present study demonstrates that C. tinctorius var. Space-1 withstands moderate doses of NaCl in the medium and that sound physiological responses of the plant help to increase secondary metabolite accumulation under salt- stressed conditions.},

abstract = {The ongoing climate change affects biogeochemical cycling in terrestrial ecosystems, but the magnitude and direction of this impact is yet unclear. To shed further light on the climate change impact, we investigated alterations in the soil nitrogen (N) cycling in a Danish heathland after 5 years of exposure to three climate change factors, i.e. warming, elevated CO2 (eCO2) and summer drought, applied both in isolation and in combination. By conducting laboratory 15N tracing experiments we show that warming increased both gross N mineralization and nitrification rates. In contrast, gross nitrification was decreased by eCO2, an effect that was more pronounced when eCO2 was combined with warming and drought. Moreover, there was an interactive effect between the warming and CO2 treatment, especially for N mineralization: rates increased at warming alone but decreased at warming combined with eCO2. In the full treatment combination, simulating the predicted climate for the year 2075, gross N transformations were only moderately affected compared to control, suggesting a minor alteration of the N cycle due to climate change. Overall, our study confirms the importance of multifactorial field experiments for a better understanding of N cycling in a changing climate, which is a prerequisite for more reliable model predictions of ecosystems responses to climate change.},

abstract = {An experiment was conducted to determine the influence of crop rotations on soil seed bank to provide a comparison between crop fields and non-crop lands. Crop rotations were continuous dryland wheat (Wd), continuous irrigated wheat (Wi), wheat-sugarbeet (WS) and wheat-chickpea (WCh). Nearby pastures (P) and orchards (Or) were also studied for comparison purposes. Estimates of the density of seed banks ranged from 52779 seed m−2 in P to 9906 seeds m−2 in Wd. A total of 114 plant species from 24 families were identified from seeds collected from different farms. 33 weed species were at high frequency in weed communities. Crop rotations were dominated by annual weed species, while the weed species dominated in P were mostly not found in any crop rotation. The two weed species Roemeria refracta and Eragrostis cilianensis were frequently present in all the study sites. Amaranthus chlorostachys and Euphorbia esula were more abundant in the areas of moderate to high disturbance. In SW and WS rotations, due to use of grass herbicides and hand weeding, winter annual broadleaves such as Lactuca serriola and Anchusa italica were the prominent species in the seed bank. Results showed that a number of weed species are adapted to a specific crop sequences and disturbance levels. Weed species richness, seed bank abundance and diversity in soil depths are highly dependent on disturbance levels. The current study highlights the importance of agricultural practices including crop sequences or disturbance levels in determining the characteristics of weed populations. This provides useful information to improve methods for maintaining plant population balance.},

Inferences about the transformation and about the parameters of the linear model are made by computing the likelihood function and the relevant posterior distribution. The contributions of normality, homoscedasticity and additivity to the transformation are separated.

Root penetrability and biomechanical properties are likely to vary in the root system dependent on anatomical structure. No information is available to date on the influence of root anatomical phenes on root penetrability and biomechanics. Root penetration ability was evaluated using a wax layer system. Root tensile and bending strength were evaluated in plant roots grown in the greenhouse and in the field. Root anatomical phenes were found to be better predictors of root penetrability than root diameter per se and associated with smaller distal cortical region cell size. Smaller outer cortical region cells play an important role in stabilizing the root against ovalization and reducing the risk of local buckling and collapse during penetration, thereby increasing root penetration of hard layers. The use of stele diameter was found to be a better predictor of root tensile strength than root diameter. Cortical thickness, cortical cell count, cortical cell wall area and distal cortical cell size were stronger predictors of root bend strength than root diameter. Our results indicate that root anatomical phenes are important predictors for root penetrability of high-strength layers and root biomechanical properties.},

These findings indicate that the functions of anthocyanin biosynthesis genes in grapevine are conservative and might be sensitive to low temperature. In order to identify the specific expression patterns of the five anthocyanin biosynthesis genes and the changes of polyphenols, anthocyanins and flavonoids under low temperature stress. The transcription analysis of the five genes and the content of polyphenols, anthocyanins and flavonoids in grape skins were examined, by using Vitis vinifera L. cv. ‘Yongyou 1' and ‘Juxing' berries as experimental material and treated at 4 °C and 25 °C for 24 h, 48 h, 72 h and 96 h. The results showed that low temperature greatly enhanced the expression of the five anthocyanin biosynthesis genes. Low temperature greatly slowed down the decomposition of polyphenol, anthocyanin, and flavonoid in grape skins. Our study also found that cv. ‘Juxing' responded more sensitively to low temperature than cv. ‘Yongyou 1'. All the findings would provide a basis for further study on the mechanism of anthocyanin biosynthesis under environmental stress.},

abstract = {Hand harvested Lee 68 soybean seed were rapidly aged to produce six sublots differing in physiological quality. The deterioration of these sublots under moderately adverse storage conditions was then characterized in terms of the sequence, degree and direction of change in selected physiological parameters. Deterioration was first manifested in an increased sensitivity or susceptibility of the seed to environment stress (accelerated aging, high and low temperatures). Later during the storage period, rate of germination decreased and RQ increased. Finally, germination percentage, rate of seedling growth, and O2 consumption decreased in that order. In a parallel study, it was demonstrated that permeability of the seed to TTC increased with degree of deterioration, but formazan production decreased when the permeability factor was eliminated. Accelerated aging, cold test, and hot water treatment responses were most closely associated with longevity of the seed in storage.},

abstract = {Kale plants are usually sold “in natura” in street markets and malls. Kale leaves can have their appearance compromised by dehydration and discoloration due to increased post-harvest time exposure. We aimed to analyze the Global Stability Index (GSI) in kale accessions by means of repeated measurement analysis and curve grouping as a complementary form of superior sample identification with regard to post-harvest preservation. Thirty kale accessions were evaluated using a randomized block design with four blocks and five plants per plot. Two commercial leaves per plant were collected, and kept on workbenches in the shade at a temperature of 18 ± 1 °C. Subsequently, the degrees of discoloration and dehydration, total chlorophyll content, and accumulated fresh mass loss were evaluated over a 15-day period. From these data, the GSI was calculated for each day of evaluation. In addition, using mixed models, thirteen co-variance structures were tested. For graphical analysis, thirteen linear and non-linear models were assessed followed by curve grouping using multivariate analysis. The GSI was efficient for differentiating accessions, which became an important tool in post-harvest studies. GSI values were not equally correlated, therefore the use of mixed models became an important approach. The unstructured matrix was the best fit to model the dependence of error. The Melow I model was the best fit for studying the GSI. The accessions UFVJM-10, UFLA-1, COM-1, UFVJM-32, COM-3, UFVJM-8, UFVJM-36 and UFVJM-24, belonging to 3 and 5 clusters, are recommended for crop cultivation and as parental material in breeding programs.Key words: Brassica oleracea var. acephala DC; post-harvest preservation; repeated measurements; multivariate statistics; curve grouping},

abstract = {This paper reports the correlation between the rheological properties of bread wheat dough and the types and quantities of endosperm proteins in 28 common wheat cultivars. Different methods were used to analyse the allelic composition of these cultivars and the relative quantities of the different proteins contributing to the gluten structure. Neither dough strength (W) nor tenacity/extensibility (P/L) correlated with allelic composition. Different wheats with the same allelic composition (i.e., with respect to glutenins) showed different rheological properties. The glutenins were the most influential components of W and P/L, especially the high molecular weight (HMW) glutenin subunits and in particular the type x form. These proteins seem to increase W and are the main constituents of the gluten network. The gliadins and low molecular weight (LMW) glutenin subunits appear to act as a “solvent”, and thus modify the rheological properties of the dough by either interfering with the polymerisation of the HMW glutenin subunits, or by altering the relative amounts of the different types of glutenin available. Thus, the protein subunits coded for by the alleles Glu-B1x7 and Glu-D1x5 stabilised the gluten network, whereas those coded for by Glu-B1x17 and Glu-D1x2 had the opposite effect. Dough properties therefore appear to depend on the glutenin/gliadins balance, and on the ratio of the type x and type y HMW proteins. The influence of external factors seems to depend on the allelic composition of each cultivar.},

@article{littell_modelling_2000-1,
abstract = {The term 'repeated measures' refers to data with multiple observations on the same sampling unit. In most cases, the multiple observations are taken over time, but they could be over space. It is usually plausible to assume that observations on the same unit are correlated. Hence, statistical analysis of repeated measures data must address the issue of covariation between measures on the same unit. Until recently, analysis techniques available in computer software only offered the user limited and inadequate choices. One choice was to ignore covariance structure and make invalid assumptions. Another was to avoid the covariance structure issue by analysing transformed data or making adjustments to otherwise inadequate analyses. Ignoring covariance structure may result in erroneous inference, and avoiding it may result in inefficient inference. Recently available mixed model methodology permits the covariance structure to be incorporated into the statistical model. The MIXED procedure of the SAS((R)) System provides a rich selection of covariance structures through the RANDOM and REPEATED statements. Modelling the covariance structure is a major hurdle in the use of PROC MIXED. However, once the covariance structure is modelled, inference about fixed effects proceeds essentially as when using PROC GLM. An example from the pharmaceutical industry is used to illustrate how to choose a covariance structure. The example also illustrates the effects of choice of covariance structure on tests and estimates of fixed effects. In many situations, estimates of linear combinations are invariant with respect to covariance structure, yet standard errors of the estimates may still depend on the covariance structure.},

abstract = {In this study, a new variable selection method called bootstrapping soft shrinkage (BOSS) method is developed. It is derived from the idea of weighted bootstrap sampling (WBS) and model population analysis (MPA). The weights of variables are determined based on the absolute values of regression coefficients. WBS is applied according to the weights to generate sub-models and MPA is used to analyze the sub-models to update weights for variables. The optimization procedure follows the rule of soft shrinkage, in which less important variables are not eliminated directly but are assigned smaller weights. The algorithm runs iteratively and terminates until the number of variables reaches one. The optimal variable set with the lowest root mean squared error of cross-validation (RMSECV) is selected. The method was tested on three groups of near infrared (NIR) spectroscopic datasets, i.e. corn datasets, diesel fuels datasets and soy datasets. Three high performing variable selection methods, i.e. Monte Carlo uninformative variable elimination (MCUVE), competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) and genetic algorithm partial least squares (GA-PLS) are used for comparison. The results show that BOSS is promising with improved prediction performance. The Matlab codes for implementing BOSS are freely available on the website: http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/52770-boss.},

abstract = {Hyperspectral sensing can provide an effective means for fast and non-destructive estimation of crop above ground nitrogen (N) status. In this study, quantitative correlations between above ground N uptake and ground-based canopy hyperspectral reflectance in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were investigated. Field experiments were conducted over four years at different sites (Xinyang, Zhengzhou and Shangshui) in Henan, China. Different N rates, planting densities, basal/topdressing N ratios and wheat cultivars were tested, and a novel spectral index was developed with improved predictive capacity for above ground N uptake estimation. Linear regression was integrated with previously reported CIred-edge3 and MTCI indices to investigate the dynamic nature of above ground N uptake, which resulted in coefficients (R2) of 0.761 and 0.760, and square error values (SE) of 4.527 and 4.534, respectively. The optimum combination of SR (759,742) and ND (759,742) were derived from two waveband-based algorithms that corresponded to red-edge ratio spectral indices. R2 for the novel SR and ND models was 0.794 and 0.788, respectively, confirming the superiority of the SR index. The modified red-edge ratio (mRER) was constructed based on the ratio vegetation index (RVI) that was derived from the third waveband ($\lambda$3) using the formula (R759 − 1.8 × R419)/(R742 − 1.8 × R419). This novel index was highly correlated with above ground N uptake and had the highest R2 (0.813) and lowest root mean square error (4.005) of all models tested. Fitting independent data to the equations resulted in RMSE values of 21.9, 20.4, 18.6 and 16.4{\%} between measured and estimated above ground N uptake values for CIred-edge3, MTCI, SR(759,742) and mRER, respectively, further indicating a superior fit and better performance for mRER. These models can therefore accurately estimate above ground N uptake in winter wheat, and the novel mRER index is superior for estimating above ground N uptake on a regional scale in heterogeneous fields under variable climatic conditions.},

abstract = {Total protein and nitrogen concentrations in plants generally decline under elevated CO2 atmospheres. Explanations for this decline include that plants under elevated CO2 grow larger, diluting the protein within their tissues; that carbohydrates accumulate within leaves, downregulating the amount of the most prevalent protein Rubisco; that carbon enrichment of the rhizosphere leads to progressively greater limitations of the nitrogen available to plants; and that elevated CO2 directly inhibits plant nitrogen metabolism, especially the assimilation of nitrate into proteins in leaves of C3 plants. Recently, several meta-analyses have indicated that CO2 inhibition of nitrate assimilation is the explanation most consistent with observations. Here, we present the first direct field test of this explanation. We analysed wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grown under elevated and ambient CO2 concentrations in the free-air CO2 enrichment experiment at Maricopa, Arizona. In leaf tissue, the ratio of nitrate to total nitrogen concentration and the stable isotope ratios of organic nitrogen and free nitrate showed that nitrate assimilation was slower under elevated than ambient CO2. These findings imply that food quality will suffer under the CO2 levels anticipated during this century unless more sophisticated approaches to nitrogen fertilization are employed.},

Nevertheless, high stability was also identified in some pure lines. The repeatability of mean grain yield (rk 2=0.73) was higher than Wi 2 (rk 2=0.18).

abstract = {Integration of stability of performance with yield is essential in yield trials. Methods that select for high yield and stability have been developed, but have not been compared for their usefulness. Our objective was to compare these methods and to study their relationship to yield and the stability-variance statistic ($\sigma$21). We compared Kang's (1988b) rank-sum method (Index 1; equal weights for yield and $\sigma$21) and four additional rank-sum indices [two (Index 2), three (Index 3), four (Index 4), and five (Index 5) times more weight for yield than for stability variance] with H{\"{u}}hn's (1979) S31 and S61 statistics, and Lin and Binns' (1988) P1. All statistics were calculated for each of five sets of data from international maize (Zea mays L.) yield trials. In Set 1, low $\sigma$21's (indicative of stable performance) were generally associated with high yield (r3 = 0.73), but in Set 2 low $\sigma$21's appeared to be associated with low yield (r3 = -0.46). Index 1 ranks were positively correlated with $\sigma$21 ranks in Sets 2 to 5 as were S31 ranks. Index 1 and S31 offered an opportunity to select for both stability based on $\sigma$21 and yield. Indices 2, 3, 4, and 5, and P1 favored selection primarily for yield. It was assumed that the top 50{\%} genotypes would be selected, in Sets 1 and 2, on the basis of yield rank alone or individual statistics. In Set 1, Index 1 was slightly more conservative than S31, in that Index 1 selected a higher yielding genotype from the two lowest yielding genotypes than did S31. S61 was slightly more conservative than Index 1. Index 1 was intermediate between S31 and S61. In Set 2, Index 1 and Index 2 were more conservative than $\sigma$31, whereas $\sigma$61 was more conservative than Index 1, but less conservative than Index 2. P1 favored selection for yield only. We concluded that Kang's rank-sum method (Index 1 here) and H{\"{u}}hn's S31 and S61 statistics would be useful for simultaneously selecting for yield and yield stability.

abstract = {Statistical inference for linear models has classically focused on either estimation or hypothesis testing of linear combinations of fixed effects or of variance components for random effects. A third form of inference-prediction of linear combinations of fixed and random effects-has important advantages over conventional estimators in many applications. None of these approaches will result in accurate inference if the data contain strong, unaccounted for local gradients, such as spatial trends in field-plot data. Nearest neighbor methods to adjust for such trends have been widely discussed in recent literature. So far, however, these methods have been developed exclusively for classical estimation and hypothesis testing. In this article a method of obtaining nearest neighbor adjusted (NNA) predictors, along the lines of "best linear unbiased prediction," or BLUP, is developed. A simulation study comparing "NNABLUP" to conventional NNA methods and to non-NNA alternatives suggests considerable potential for improved efficiency.},

Psychologists have traditionally thought of sample size planning in terms of power analysis. Although we review recent advances in power analysis, our main focus is the desirability of achieving accurate parameter estimates, either instead of or in addition to obtaining sufficient power. Accuracy in parameter estimation (AIPE) has taken on increasing importance in light of recent emphasis on effect size estimation and formation of confidence intervals. The review provides an overview of the logic behind sample size planning for AIPE and summarizes recent advances in implementing this approach in designs commonly used in psychological research.},

abstract = {Plants may respond to drought by altering biomass allocation to shoots and roots or by changing the metabolic activities in these organs. To determine how drought changes the partitioning of carbon allocated to growth and secondary metabolism in maize roots and how it affects photosynthesis (A) and productivity in maize, we evaluated leaf gas exchange, yield componentes, root morphology, and primary and secondary metabolites including total soluble sugars (TSS), starch (S), phenolics (PHE), and lignin (LIG). Data were collected from pot-grown plants of four maize genotypes: BRS 1010 and 2B710 (sensitive genotypes) and DKB390 and BRS1055 (tolerant genotypes) under two soil water tensions: field capacity (FC, − 18 kPa) and water deficit (WD, − 138 kPa). WD was applied at the pre-flowering stage for 12 days and then the water supply was restored and maintained at optimum levels until the end of the cycle. For genotype BRS 1055 under FC, the greatest A did not result in greater grain biomass (DGB) because the accumulated photoassimilates had already filled the cells, and thus the excessive TSS synthesized in leaves was allocated to roots in large amounts. However, the sharp decrease in A caused by WD imposition in this genotype did not affect the influx pressure of leaf TSS, which was due largely to conversion of primary metabolites to PHE compounds to increase the length of fine roots. In leaves of DKB390 under WD, both S and TSS were reduced, whereas PHE were increased to prevent excessive water loss and xylem cavitation. Under WD, both BRS1010 and 2B710 genotypes displayed reduced allocation of biomass to shoots and roots and LIG content in leaves, as well as lower A and DGB values. In BRS1010 this response was coupled to S decrease in leaves and TSS increase in roots, whereas in 2B710 there was a concomitant S increase in roots.},

abstract = {Phenolic compounds have numerous beneficial effects on human health. In consequence, the development of new varieties with higher content of phenolics is of interest for the improvement of the nutritional quality of eggplant (Solanum melongena L.). However, the oxidation of eggplant phenolics causes browning of the cut surfaces of the fruit and reduces its apparent quality. The authors investigated the relationship among, as well as the variation and heritability of, the content of phenolics, ascorbic acid, and soluble solids; pH; and the degree of browning and color difference of the cut surface of the fruit flesh in a collection of 69 eggplant varieties. These included landraces from different origins, commercial varieties, experimental hybrids, and four accessions of the related S. aethiopicum L. and S. macrocarpon L. species. Analyses of variance revealed significant differences among the materials studied for all traits considered. The concentration of phenolics in S. melongena spanned a threefold range, although the highest (1122 mg{\textperiodcentered}kg−1) and lowest (134 mg{\textperiodcentered}kg−1) concentrations of phenolics were found in S. macrocarpon and S. aethiopicum respectively. Concentrations of ascorbic acid were very low, a mean 27 times lower than those of phenolics, and soluble solids content ranged from 3.60{\%} to 6.60{\%} with a pH that ranged from 5.01 to 5.93. Commercial varieties had, as a mean, a 20{\%} lower concentration of phenolics than landraces, as well as a lower degree of browning and color difference. Positive correlations existed between phenolic concentration and degree of browning (r = 0.388) and color difference (0.477), although only 15.1{\%} and 22.8{\%} of the total variation in degree of browning and color difference, respectively, could be attributed to variation in phenolics. Ascorbic acid, soluble solids content, and pH were not correlated to either degree of browning or color difference. The heritability was moderate for phenolic concentration (0.50) and high for degree of browning (0.71) and color difference (0.82). The information obtained indicates that there are opportunities for the development of new varieties with a high concentration of phenolics and low or moderate browning.},

abstract = {This study evaluated the sample sizes necessary to estimate several soil and vegetation characteristics within 10{\%} confidence intervals with 95{\%} probability in three terra firme tropical rainforest sites. Across all three plots, the most spatially heterogeneous variables were measurements of total standing crop root mass, ground surface litter mass, litter fall, root growth and soil respiration which required, on average, 152, 105, 52, 45 and 28 samples, respectively to estimate mean values within 10{\%} confidence intervals with 95{\%} probability. Leaf area index measurements integrated canopy characteristics over a relatively large spatial area and therefore only required five samples, on average, to achieve the same degree of precision. Measurements of soil temperature, moisture, carbon and nitrogen content in the surface 30 cm soil layer displayed the lowest degree of spatial variation: requiring a maximum of seven samples to estimate mean values within 10{\%} confidence intervals with 95{\%} probability. This study, together with a review of data from similar ecosystems, suggests that standing crop root mass, root growth, litter fall and ground surface litter mass are usually acutely under-sampled, which could impede detection and interpretation of patterns and processes in these potentially important ecosystem characteristics. This information may assist researchers to design effective sampling strategies for field experiments, particularly in tropical forests.},

@article{coventry_wheat_2011,
abstract = {Of the wheat grown in North-West India the majority is consumed as traditional Indian flat bread (chapatti). Chapatti quality is important to consumers and people are willing to pay more for better quality wheat flour, but farmers do not specifically target quality outcomes as the majority of their wheat is sold with no segregation. For farmers the main objective is to harvest maximum yields, but in the last decade productivity growth for wheat yields has slowed in the areas where the wheat is grown in a double cropping pattern. Nutrient depletion and temperature-related stress are possible causes for this decline in productivity growth. Farmers meanwhile are looking to opportunities to maintain profitability and, with consumers willing to pay a higher price for better chapatti wheat, an opportunity exists for farmers to manage their wheat to improve both the yield as well as quality of wheat. In this paper we evaluate management practices that best achieve high yield and better chapatti quality, and assess the temperature environment for the winter wheat growing season. A step-wise analysis of the long-term temperature trend for sites in NW India showed that mean annual temperature has increased by 0.7–1.0 °C during the last decade. Field experiments with wheat varieties (C-306, WH-283, DBW-17, PBW-343, PBW-502, PBW-550, Raj-3765 and WH-1025) were conducted at farmers' fields under 4 different sequential cropping rotations for the 2007–08 and 2008–09 winter seasons in Haryana (India). C-306 and WH-283 are varieties with excellent chapatti quality but are lower yielding by 15–26{\%} than the more widely grown varieties such as PBW-343 and PBW-502. The replicated experiments involved three sowing times, these being an early sowing (late October to early November, timely sowing (mid November) and a late sowing (early December). A differential response of varieties was observed to sowing time with the yield of C-306 better whereas that of WH-283 and Raj-3765 was poor in early sown conditions. The varieties DBW-17, PBW-343 and PBW-502 were the highest yielding wheat with similar performance under early as well as timely sowing. All the varieties had lowest yield in December sowing. In general, late sowing had lower thousand grain weight but higher protein content. Of the quality measure grain hardness was the only attribute with a consistent positive correlation with chapatti quality. The chapatti score was higher for varieties C-306 and WH-283 compared to the other varieties but grain hardness and chapatti score was not much affected by sowing time. With all varieties included in the analysis there was no correlation between protein and chapatti score, but within an individual variety usually higher protein resulted in a higher chapatti score. There was no association of grain test weight or sedimentation value with chapatti score. From the results shown here it is evident that farmers will be able to manage with variety choice and timely sowing to obtain chapatti quality without losing grain yield benefits.},

abstract = {Twenty cassava genotypes were arranged in a randomised complete block design with three replications and assessed for growth and yield stability using the additive main effect and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) analysis. Highly significant ( P {\textless} 0.00 1 ) effects of genotype, environment, and genotype ⁎ environment interaction were observed for all traits studied. The AMMI analysis of variance indicated that genotype accounted for 51{\%} of the total sum of squares for height at first branching followed by environment (33{\%}) and interaction (15{\%}). For fresh root yield, environment effects accounted for 37{\%} of the total sum of squares, whilst genotype and interaction accounted for 32{\%} and 29{\%}, respectively. Genotypic variances for harvest index (HI), plant height, storage root yield, and dry matter content contributed a greater proportion of the phenotypic variance indicating stronger genetic control. This suggests better chance of progress in the genetic improvement of these traits. Genotype MM96/1751 combined high yield with stability according to the yield stability index ranking across environments. On the other hand genotypes UCC 2001/449 and 96/1708 though high yielding were unstable according to AMMI stability value scores. However they can be tested further in more environments to ascertain their specific adaptability for release to farmers for cultivation to boost cassava production and ensure food security.},

Methyl jasmonate, a common plant secondary compound, when applied to surfaces of tomato plants, induces the synthesis of defensive proteinase inhibitor proteins in the treated plants and in nearby plants as well. The presence of methyl jasmonate in the atmosphere of chambers containing plants from three species of two families, Solanaceae and Fabaceae, results in the accumulation of proteinase inhibitors in leaves of all three species. When sagebrush, Artemisia tridentata, a plant shown to possess methyl jasmonate in leaf surface structures, is incubated in chambers with tomato plants, proteinase inhibitor accumulation is induced in the tomato leaves, demonstrating that interplant communication can occur from leaves of one species of plant to leaves of another species to activate the expression of defensive genes.},

Seeds were germinated in Petri dishes on two sheets of filter paper moistened with saline (NaCl) at different concentrations and maintained in germination temperature of 20-30° C and photoperiod-eight hours, after were subjected to assessment of their physiological quality through tests of germination and vigor. The presence of salts in the soaking solution resulted in decreased seed vigor as the osmotic potential of the soaking solution has become more negative, indicating that the seeds of broccoli cultivar Santana has low tolerance to salinity.},

abstract = {Developing soybean cultivars with high seed protein concentration has been hampered by the negative correlation between seed protein and seed yield. While previous in vitro studies have documented the impact of assimilate supply to the seed in determining seed protein, in planta studies generally have failed to link seed protein accumulation directly with assimilate supply per plant during seed filling. It may be possible to reconcile this apparent contradiction by expressing the relationship between seed protein and assimilate supply in planta on a per seed basis. We evaluated the association between seed composition and assimilate supply per seed in closely related experimental lines varying in seed protein concentration and in several elite varieties from the Iowa State University breeding program. High seed protein content was associated with greater leaf area per seed at R5.5, which was a consequence of fewer seeds set per plant. The more favorable source/sink ratio provided greater assimilate per seed during grain filling, but limited the yield potential of the high protein lines because of reduced seed set. Depodding during grain filling increased seed size of low protein lines and increased seed protein concentration to levels comparable to those in the untreated high protein lines. Seed size was far less responsive to depodding in the high protein lines. These results suggest that high protein lines maintain assimilate supply per seed at or near saturating levels during seed filling. Improving seed protein levels in high yielding varieties will require increasing assimilate supply per seed without sacrificing seed numbers.},

@article{busscher_recompaction_2002-1,
abstract = {For many coastal plain soils in the southeastern USA, high soil strength within subsurface horizons requires that deep tillage be performed to provide a suitable rooting environment for row crops such as maize (Zea mays L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.). We hypothesized that water filtering through the soil was recompacting it and that recompaction could be correlated with cumulative amount of rainfall since tillage. We measured cone indices in a structureless, fine loamy Acrisol near Florence, South Carolina, from 7 days to about 6 years after treatments were deep tilled. Measurements were made to a depth of 0.55 m at the point of maximum disruption of a bent-leg subsoiler (Paratill{\textregistered}) that tilled to a depth of 0.35–0.40 m. Regressions of cone indices with cumulative rainfall explained 67–91{\%} of the recompaction and indicated that water filtering through the soil was causing the recompaction. Recompaction was slow, still taking place 6 years after tillage (the end of the experiment) probably because of controlled traffic or excessive disruption by the paratill. Recompaction was also temporarily greater for the 0.1–0.2 m depths when compared with that in the 0.25–0.35 m depths indicating that it was moving down the profile. Recompaction in other climates may be faster or slower depending on their cumulative rainfall relative to an annual amount of 900–1350 mm per year for this study and recompaction for structured soils may be faster or slower depending on whether the structure is stable or not. Though recompaction in this study was slow, tillage may still be necessary annually or seasonally because yield can be reduced even by incomplete recompaction that increases soil strength after a year or less.},

abstract = {The growth of lateral buds (tillers), which are undergoing release from apical dominance, was measured in upright and gravistimulated intact Avena sativa L. cv. `Victory' (oat) shoots as well as in isolated Avena stem segments treated with kinetin and sucrose. During release, the tiller bud initially shows a slow rate of elongation accompanied by swelling. It is followed by a more rapid rate of elongation. Ethylene (C2H4) production in shoot segments containing a tiller bud was found to occur at the onset of tiller swelling during gravistimulation as well as during inflorescence emergence. Exogenous application of indoleacetic acid or C2H4 inhibits kinetin-induced tiller bud swelling and elongation. However, stem segments pulsed for 24 hours in C2H4 or the C2H4 biosynthesis precursor, 1-amino-cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) and then transferred to kinetin and sucrose, showed a significant increase in swelling elongation as compared with segments maintained under the same conditions but without C2H4 or ACC in the pulse. Segments pulsed for 24 hours with kinetin and sucrose plus the ACC biosynthesis inhibitor, aminoethoxyvinylglycine, or the C2H4 action inhibitor, CO2, then transferred to kinetin and sucrose medium, showed inhibition of tiller swelling during the pulse and of subsequent elongation. These results indicate that C2H4 plays a role in promoting tiller swelling during the onset of tiller release from apical dominance and may act as a modulator hormone in promoting tiller elongation in the presence of cytokinin.},

abstract = {Nitrate and ammonium are the two most important ionic forms of inorganic nitrogen driving biomass production in marine and freshwater aquatic systems. The performance of plants and algae often changes when reared with either of these two forms of nitrogen individually, as well as when they are both present, or when cells have experienced previous periods of nitrogen starvation. Current functional responses quantifying how ambient nitrogen drives changes in population density are unable to capture interacting and transient effects of nitrate and ammonium. Hence, in this paper we formulate, calibrate, and test a new nitrate–ammonium quota model that accounts for nitrate and ammonium uptake, as well as the effects of nitrogen starvation length and ammonium-induced nitrate uptake inhibition. We fit the model with several time-series from the green alga Chlorella sp. reared in laboratory batch cultures under multiple initial conditions. We show that a single set of calibrated model parameters can capture time-series collected from experiments inoculated at 12 different initial concentrations of nitrate, ammonium, and biomass. The model also performed well when validated against time-series from two novel initial conditions withheld from model calibration. Our model therefore provides a framework for evaluating the potential broader ecological and environmental consequences of ambient nitrate and ammonium regimes for phytoplankton communities in nature and aquaculture.},

We show how the generalized ML-ANCOVA model can be estimated with multigroup multilevel structural equation models that offer considerable advantages compared to traditional ML-ANCOVA. The proposed model takes into account measurement error in the covariates, sampling error in contextual covariates, treatment-covariate interactions, and stochastic predictors.

Quantitative microautoradiography was used to follow the water-soluble 14C contents of the companion cells in minor veins after pulse-labeling with 14CO2. In both morning glory and soybean, the observed kinetics in the companion cells matched reasonably well those expected from the shape of the translocation profiles., Marked compartmentation of sucrose was evident in soybean leaves in that the specific radioactivity of total leaf sucrose was greatest immediately after labeling and quickly declined, whereas labeling in the companion cells was low at first and did not reach a maximum for about 35 minutes. In morning glory leaves, the kinetics of sucrose specific radioactivity and of companion cell-labeling more closely paralleled one another.},

The tests were conducted in the agricultural year of 2013/2014 in four growing sites in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The experimental arrangement was randomized blocks in factorial scheme (11 × 4), consisting eleven soybean genotypes in four environments with four repetitions each. All the growing environments Tapera-RS, Derrubadas-RS and Frederico Westphalen-RS were classified as favorable for soybean cultivation. The traits such as total number of pods per plant, number of branches and number of pods with 2-3 grains showed significant linear correlations with grain yield in both methods of analysis. The path analysis was applied under favorable and unfavorable environments to accurately estimate the direct and indirect effect of traits on soybean grain yield. The mass of a thousand grains and plant height were highly associated with grain yield but mostly influenced by environmental effects. The total number of pods should be prioritized for selecting superior soybean genotypes due to its direct and indirect effects on grain yield. It has shown constant in all environmental conditions. The direct effects of number of branches and number of pods (with one grain) presented distinct effects on yield in favorable and unfavorable environments.},

abstract = {Wheat–cotton rotations largely increase crop yield and improve resources use efficiency, such as the radiation use efficiency. However, little information is available on the nitrogen (N) utilization and requirement of cotton under wheat–cotton rotations. This study was to determine the N uptake and use efficiency by evaluating the cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) N use and the soil N balances, which will help to improve N resource management in wheat–cotton rotations. Field experiments were conducted during 2011/2012 and 2012/2013 growing seasons in the Yangtze River region in China. Two cotton cultivars (Siza 3, mid-late maturity with 130 days growth duration; CCRI 50, early maturity with 110 days growth duration) were planted under four cropping systems including monoculture cotton (MC), wheat/intercropped cotton (W/IC), wheat/transplanted cotton (W/TC) and wheat/direct-seeded cotton (W/DC). The N uptake and use efficiency of cotton were quantified under different cropping systems. The results showed that wheat–cotton rotations decreased the cotton N uptake through reducing the N accumulation rate and shortening the duration of fast N accumulation phase as compared to the monoculture cotton. Compared with MC, the N uptake of IC, TC and DC were decreased by 12.0{\%}, 20.5{\%} and 23.4{\%} for Siza 3, respectively, and 7.3{\%}, 10.7{\%} and 17.6{\%} for CCRI 50, respectively. Wheat–cotton rotations had a lower N harvest index as a consequence of the weaker sink capacity in the cotton plant caused by the delayed fruiting and boll formation. Wheat–cotton rotations used N inefficiently relative to the monoculture cotton, showing consistently lower level of the N agronomic use efficiency (NAE), N apparent recovery efficiency (NRE), N physiological efficiency (NPE) and N partial factor productivity (NPFP), particularly for DC. Relative to the mid–late maturity cultivar of Siza 3, the early maturity cultivar of CCRI 50 had higher N use efficiency in wheat–cotton rotations. An analysis of the crop N balance suggested that the high N excess in preceding wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in wheat–cotton rotations led to significantly higher N surpluses than the monoculture cotton. The N management for the cotton in wheat–cotton rotations should be improved by means of reducing the base fertilizer input and increasing the bloom application.},

The productive potential of this crop is closely associated with nitrogen (N) fertilization, thus, studies focused on this subject are important in the development of cropping strategies. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of N split and different type of urea on important agronomic traits of the maize crop. A randomized complete block design in a 2×2+1 factorial treatment design with four replications was used. The factorial levels were composed of two types of urea (common and coated) and two nitrogen splits (V 3 and V 3 +V 8 ), plus the control treatment (without urea application). Important agronomic traits such as grain yield, biological productivity, and yield components were assessed. It was verified that there is no difference between the common or coated urea on grain yield and its components. On the other hand, the split of nitrogen into V 3 and V 8 stages is an efficient strategy to improve grain yield as well as important features as the number of rows per ears and harvest index. Thus, by using this management system farmers can achieve a more efficient nitrogen use.},

abstract = {Assimilate partitioning was studied in the common pea (Pisum sativum L.) by feeding 14CO2 to whole plants and measuring radioactivity in different organs 48 hours after labeling. Two experimental protocols were used. For the first, one reproductive node was darkened with an aluminum foil, to prevent photosynthesis during labeling. The aim was to study assimilate translocation among nodes. The second was carried out to assess any priority among sinks. Whole plants were shaded, during labeling, to reduce carbon assimilation. Various developmental stages between the onset of flowering and the final stage in seed abortion of the last pod were chosen for labeling. When all photosynthetic structures at the first reproductive node were darkened at any stage of development after the formation of the first flower, the first pod was supplied with assimilates from other nodes. In contrast, later developed pods, when photosynthetic structures at their node were darkened, received assimilates from other nodes only when they were beyond their final stage in seed abortion. Reducing illumination to 30{\%} did not change distribution of assimilated carbon between vegetative and reproductive structures, nor among pods. It appears that the relative proportion of 14C allocated to any one pod, compared to other pods, depends on the dry weight of that pod as a proportion of the total reproductive dry weight. When the plant was growing actively, following the start of the reproductive phase until a few days before the end of flowering, the top of the plant (i.e., all the organs above the last opened flower) had a higher sink strength and a higher relative specific activity than pods, suggesting that it was a more competitive sink for assimilates. The pattern of assimilate distribution described here provides an explanation for pod and seed abortion.},

Oats with even higher protein contents would have great potential as a vegetative protein source. From a mutagenized oat population, 230 lines with seed protein levels of 15{\%} or higher were identified from green house grown plants. Fifteen lines with protein levels ranging between 17 and 24{\%} were chosen for further studies. The high protein character was confirmed by two consecutive propagations in the field. Crossings showed that the trait was stable and segregated in a Mendelian fashion. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that the major increase was in globulin like proteins. In addition, total dietary fibre, $\beta$-glucan and lipid levels were quantified. No correlation between any of these characters and the high protein trait could be found. Thousand Kernel Weight was also monitored and shown to be stable in the high protein lines. Thus, starting from the lines presented here a further development of commercial oat varieties with protein levels of 20{\%} or higher is feasible. Such a high protein oat would be very important to meet the consumers need for high-quality high-protein oat for the food and feed industry.},

abstract = {Best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) is a standard method for estimating random effects of a mixed model. This method was originally developed in animal breeding for estimation of breeding values and is now widely used in many areas of research. It does not, however, seem to have gained the same popularity in plant breeding and variety testing as it has in animal breeding. In plants, application of mixed models with random genetic effects has up until recently been mainly restricted to the estimation of genetic and non-genetic components of variance, whereas estimation of genotypic values is mostly based on a model with fixed effects. This paper reviews recent developments in the application of BLUP in plant breeding and variety testing. These include the use of pedigree information to model and exploit genetic correlation among relatives and the use of flexible variance–covariance structures for genotype-by-environment interaction. We demonstrate that BLUP has good predictive accuracy compared to other procedures. While pedigree information is often included via the so-called numerator relationship matrix {\{}$\backslash$textbackslash{\}}(($\backslash${\{}{\{}$\backslash$textbackslash{\}}user2{\{}A{\}}{\}}){\{}$\backslash$textbackslash{\}}), we stress that it is frequently straightforward to exploit the same information by a simple mixed model without explicit reference to the {\{}$\backslash$textbackslash{\}}($\backslash${\{}{\{}$\backslash$textbackslash{\}}user2{\{}A{\}}$\backslash${\}}{\{}$\backslash$textbackslash{\}})-matrix.},

abstract = {KEY MESSAGE Comparing standard errors of treatment differences using fixed or random block effects with the approximation of Kackar and Harville helps in choosing the preferable assumption for blocks in the analysis of field experiments. Blocked designs are common in plant breeding field trials. Depending on the precision of variance estimates, recovery of inter-block information via random block effects may be worthwhile. A challenge in practice is to decide when recovery of information should be pursued. To investigate this question, a series of sugar beet trials laid out as $\alpha$-designs were analysed assuming fixed or random block effects. Additionally, small trials laid out as $\alpha$-designs or partially replicated designs were simulated and analysed assuming fixed or random block effects. Nine decision rules, including the Kackar-Harville adjustment, were used for choosing the better assumption regarding the block effects. In general, use of the Kackar-Harville adjustment works well and is recommended for partially replicated designs. For $\alpha$-designs, using inter-block information is preferable for designs with four or more blocks.},

abstract = {Wheat–cotton double cropping is the leading cropping system in the Yellow River Valley and the Yangtze River Valley in China. To comprehend the effects of cropping systems on the radiation use efficiency (RUE) in wheat–cotton double cropping, field experiments involved four cropping systems, namely monoculture cotton (MC), wheat/intercropped cotton (W/IC), wheat/transplanted cotton (W/TC) and wheat/direct-seeded cotton (W/DC) and two cotton cultivars were conducted in 2011/2012 and 2012/2013. The results showed that wheat–cotton double cropping improved radiation use by increasing the intercepted photosynthetically active radiation and RUE compared with monoculture cotton. Averaged over two years, the RUE of monoculture cotton was 1.20 g DM MJ−1 for Siza 3 and 1.14 g DM MJ−1 for CCRI 50, while that of double cropped cotton was 1.19–1.93 g DM MJ−1 higher than monoculture cotton, with the RUE of cotton in W/DC was the highest, followed by in W/TC and W/IC. The analysis of cropping systems effects on cotton canopy structure and light distribution indicated that the high RUE was associated with the favorable intra-canopy light distribution. Cotton in W/IC, W/TC and W/DC system intercepted 87.1{\%}, 54.6{\%} and 44.3{\%} as much PAR as the monoculture cotton for Siza 3 and 86.9{\%}, 59.3{\%} and 46.2{\%} as much PAR as the monoculture cotton for CCRI 50, respectively. Double cropping cotton intercepted significantly lower PAR than monoculture cotton, which is the result of the lower fPAR caused by initiation shading for IC, later planting for TC and delayed sowing for DC, respectively. Our results suggest that the key factor that limits cotton production in double cropping systems is their lower PAR interception rather than the RUE. Suggestions for further increasing the productivity of radiation should be based on improved capture of radiation by cotton in wheat–cotton double cropping systems. The early maturity cultivar might be more appropriate to double cropping sequential systems.},

To assist in development of long-term control strategies, we examined in 2009 the range of diversity at the whole-plant and molecular level within and across six populations of S. molesta in Louisiana and Texas. Significant variation was observed for all five morphological traits measured both within and across collection sites. Root length was moderately associated with colony width, rhizome length, and leaf width when averaged across sites, but not when each location was evaluated separately. Cluster analysis revealed that S. molesta could be grouped into three to five distinct groups depending on the trait under consideration. Fruiting bodies (sporocarps) were observed only at one south Louisiana location. The salvinia weevil, Cyrtobagous salviniae Calder {\&} Sands, was not found at any location during this study. Analysis of Molecular Variance of AFLP markers and DNA sequence analysis of the gapCp gene showed that the majority of molecular variation was detected within populations (87–93{\%}) compared to diversity among populations (7–13{\%}). Location (environment) was considered to be the most important source of variation for all measured traits. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of AFLP and gapCp data revealed distinct clusters comprised of members across different collection sites. Although substantial morphological and molecular variations were detected both within and among populations, all data from this study suggested that these six populations were derived originally from the same clonal or related populations.},

Experiments were performed inside an east–west oriented greenhouse (total area of 960 m2), where the south-oriented roofs were completely covered with multi-crystalline silicon PV modules, with a total rated power of 68 kWp. The PV system reduced the availability of solar radiation inside the greenhouse by 64{\%}, compared to the situation without PV system (2684 MJ m−2 on yearly basis). The solar radiation distribution followed a north–south gradient, with more solar energy on the sidewalls and decreasing towards the center of the span, except in winter, where it was similar in all plant rows. The reduction under the plastic and PV covers was respectively 46{\%} and 82{\%} on yearly basis. Only a 18{\%} reduction was observed on the plant rows farthest from the PV cover of the span. The supplementary lighting, powered without exceeding the energy produced by the PV array, was not enough to affect the crop production, whose revenue was lower than the cost for heating and lighting. The distribution of the solar radiation observed is useful for choosing the most suitable crops and for designing PV greenhouses with the attitude for both energy and crop production.},

abstract = {1. Review of published ecological studies using path analysis suggests that path analysis is often misused and collinearity is a moderate to severe problem in a majority of the analyses. 2. Multiple regression is shown to be related to path analysis, and thus collinearity, which is a well-known problem in regression analysis, can also be a problem in path analysis. Collinearity occurs when independent variables are highly correlated and causes estimates of standardized partial regression coefficients and of path coefficients to be less precise, less accurate and prone to rounding error. 3. A review of 24 path analyses in 12 papers revealed incorrectly calculated path coefficients in 13 cases and problems with collinearity in 15 cases. Estimates of path coefficients are biased and lack precision if there is collinearity. 4. An additional 40 path analyses could not be evaluated because of incomplete information. Most studies lack sufficient sample size to justify the use of path analysis. Problems associated with the use of categorical variables, which were used in six cases, are unappreciated. 5. These problems suggest that path coefficients may often mislead ecologists about the relative importance of ecological processes.},

abstract = {Recent petroleum crises, increasing cost and unavailability of petroleum diesel gave impetus to the search for an alternative fuel. Among the renewable fuels, the ones that are produced from oilseeds and food waste as the sources are favored by the majority of researchers because of their ability to minimize air pollution and emission of greenhouse gases and also to achieve reduction of dependency on fuel import, which result in reducing the overall energy cost. Biodiesel can be considered as the optimum alternative fuel for diesel fuel in Turkey. The biodiesel production potential from oil seeds such as soybean, peanut, sunflower, sesame, safflower, canola, cottonseed, flaxseed, hempseed and poppyseed in Turkey was investigated. Purpose of this study is to examine the potential of biodiesel in Turkey in parallel with global developments and agricultural products used in biodiesel energy production. In the present study, data was received from Turkish Statistical Institute. Around Turkey, 1.17 million ha of land from 81 provinces are predicted to be suitable land for growing of oil seeds. There are approximately 3.31 million tons of oil seed crops in Turkey that can potentially produce 1.12 million tons every year. Furthermore, there are 4.15 million ha fallow land in Turkey. When the production of oil seed crops were realized in these area, approximately 11.74 million tons of seeds can be produced. In Turkey, water is a main problem for growing plants, so that drought-resistant oil seed crops will be produced such as safflower, and poppy seed etc. Based on the results, drought-resistant oil seed crops can be grown in Turkey and these oils can be used in biodiesel production industry.},

The mechanism through which constitutive expression and inducibility mediate resistance and, hence physiological and ecological factors that affect their evolution are still little understood. Here I propose information transfer as the least common denominator function of PSM production. In this framework constitutively produced PSMs represent the first line of defense through functioning as toxins, cues associated with toxicity and as detractants that interfere with antagonist host-search patterns. Information made available and utilizable by inducibility of secondary metabolite production allows plants to include the associated biological communities to cope with antagonists and to more efficiently target a specific attacker.},

Six sensory parameters (i.e., soymilk aroma, smoothness in the mouth, thickness in the mouth, sweetness, colour and appearance, and overall acceptability) and a seven-point hedonic scale for each parameter were developed. Significant positive correlations were observed between overall acceptability and the other five evaluation parameters, suggesting that overall acceptability is an ideal parameter for evaluating soymilk flavour. The soymilk sensory attributes were significantly positively correlated with the characteristics of the glycinin (11S)/beta-conglycinin (7S) protein ratio, soluble solid, and oil content but negatively correlated with glycitein and protein content. Our results indicated that soymilk sensory attributes could be improved by selecting the desirable seed chemical quality traits in practical soybean breeding programs.},

The amount of 928 morphometric measurements and 2918 weights were collected. Phenotypic characterization was carried out using size, weight, colour and conformation of the animals, as well as 16 morphometric measurements of the animals. Phenotypic data were analysed using PROC GLM, CORR and PRINCOMP of Statistical Analysis System (SAS{\textregistered}). The distance between breeds was carried out using morphometric and morphological data using UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method Arithmetic Mean) method to create a dendrogram. Phenotypic characterization was shown to be an accessible and easy to use tool in conservation and breeding programs. The breed was the most important factor to differentiate between the animals measured, and adult weight most influenced by the environment.

Although multiple regression is commonly used in such cases to test the individual effects of many explanatory variables on a continuous response, the inherent collinearity (multicollinearity) of confounded explanatory variables encumbers analyses and threatens their statistical and inferential interpretation. Using numerical simulations, I quantified the impact of multicollinearity on ecological multiple regression and found that even low levels of collinearity bias analyses (r ≥ 0.28 or r2 ≥ 0.08), causing (1) inaccurate model parameterization, (2) decreased statistical power, and (3) exclusion of significant predictor variables during model creation. Then, using real ecological data, I demonstrated the utility of various statistical techniques for enhancing the reliability and interpretation of ecological multiple regression in the presence of multicollinearity.},

abstract = {Angiosperms are the most diverse and numerous group of plants, and it is generally accepted that this evolutionary success owes in part to the diversity found in fruits, key for protecting the developing seeds and ensuring seed dispersal. Although studies on the molecular basis of morphological innovations are few, they all illustrate the central role played by transcription factors acting as developmental regulators. Here, we show that a small change in the protein sequence of a MADS-box transcription factor correlates with the origin of a highly modified fruit morphology and the change in seed dispersal strategies that occurred in Medicago, a genus belonging to the large legume family. This protein sequence modification alters the functional properties of the protein, affecting the affinities for other protein partners involved in high-order complexes. Our work illustrates that variation in coding regions can generate evolutionary novelties not based on gene duplication/subfunctionalization but by interactions in complex networks, contributing also to the current debate on the relative importance of changes in regulatory or coding regions of master regulators in generating morphological novelties.},

Jemalong (barrel medic) were evaluated in irrigated pastures at Gatton in southeastern Queensland in 3 experiments over 2 years. In pure swards, defoliation every 6 weeks at the lowest cutting height (5 cm) gave the highest yields of both oats (10 t DM/ha) and ryegrass (12.6 t DM/ha). There were fewer live tillers per m2 of both oats and ryegrass cut at 6-week intervals compared with more frequent defoliations. However, tiller numbers of both were unaffected by cutting height. Lengthening the regrowth period from 2 to 6 weeks reduced nitrogen concentration by 23{\%} (from 4, 75{\%}) for ryegrass and by 16{\%} (from 4.22{\%}) for oats but increased cell wall content of oats from 38 to 45{\%} and ryegrass from 36 to 41{\%}.

abstract = {Methodologies using restricted maximum likelihood/best linear unbiased prediction (REML/BLUP) in combination with sequential path analysis in maize are still limited in the literature. Therefore, the aims of this study were: i) to use REML/BLUP-based procedures in order to estimate variance components, genetic parameters, and genotypic values of simple maize hybrids, and ii) to fit stepwise regressions considering genotypic values to form a path diagram with multi-order predictors and minimum multicollinearity that explains the relationships of cause and effect among grain yield-related traits. Fifteen commercial simple maize hybrids were evaluated in multi-environment trials in a randomized complete block design with four replications. The environmental variance (78.80{\%}) and genotype-vs-environment variance (20.83{\%}) accounted for more than 99{\%} of the phenotypic variance of grain yield, which difficult the direct selection of breeders for this trait. The sequential path analysis model allowed the selection of traits with high explanatory power and minimum multicollinearity, resulting in models with elevated fit (R(2) {\textgreater} 0.9 and $\epsilon$ {\textless} 0.3). The number of kernels per ear (NKE) and thousand-kernel weight (TKW) are the traits with the largest direct effects on grain yield (r = 0.66 and 0.73, respectively). The high accuracy of selection (0.86 and 0.89) associated with the high heritability of the average (0.732 and 0.794) for NKE and TKW, respectively, indicated good reliability and prospects of success in the indirect selection of hybrids with high-yield potential through these traits. The negative direct effect of NKE on TKW (r = -0.856), however, must be considered. The joint use of mixed models and sequential path analysis is effective in the evaluation of maize-breeding trials.},

Statistical confidence intervals are used to demonstrate harmful effects of collinearity. The harmful effects increase by reducing the range of the independent variable data and/or its precision. Using only independent variable data, the new collinearity indicator allows the identification of the point where the number of terms in a particular regression model becomes larger than can be justified on statistical grounds. The use of the new criterion can improve experimental design in order to minimize the harmful effects of collinearity and enable a rapid screen of correlations published in the literature for identifying those that include more parameters than can be justified.},

abstract = {Drought stress causes various physiologic and biochemical effects in plants. The phytohormones in plant systems are closely involved in responses against drought stress. However, information on the regulatory effect of abscisic acid (ABA), and free polyamine (PA) metabolism on the accumulation of JA is limited. Elucidating the endogenous mechanisms that confer stress resistance is essential to providing insights into the potential of plants to adapt to environmental change. This study aims to determine the relationship between the concentrations of abscisic acid (ABA) and jasmonic acid (JA) and the accumulation of free PAs (putrescine, spermine, and spermidine), as well as with polyamine oxidase (PAO) activity, in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum M.) seedlings grown hydroponically under polyethylene glycol – induced drought stress. The results indicate that the concentrations of endogenous ABA, JA, and free polyamines, and the PAO activity in the roots and leaves of tomato seedlings were generally higher in the treatment groups than in the untreated controls. A significantly positive correlation was observed between the concentrations of endogenous polyamines and PAO activity (R = 0.708**) in roots and leaves of tomato seedlings. The time course in the present experiment demonstrated that the ABA concentrations increase in the roots prior to that in the leaves. Therefore, under drought stress, the higher concentrations of endogenous spermine and spermidine in the roots and leaves stimulate the simultaneous accumulation of endogenous ABA and JA with increasing PAO activity.},

A huge achievement in food production since 1949 has been made. The regression analysis in each period of 10 years shows that there is a significant positive linear correlation between the annual food production and annual chemical fertilizer N (CF-N) consumption throughout 1949–1998. However, the regression coefficient, b, in each period of 10 years since 1949 has been declining rapidly. Meanwhile, environmental pollution is becoming a serious issue. In last 20 years, N concentratjons in surface and ground water have been increasing, `Alga blooms' in lakes and `red tides' in estuaries occur frequently, and the emissions of N2O and NH3 from farmlands rise. This paper reviews the causes for the declining N efficiency and rising environmental impacts, and the strategies for better fertilizer management.},

abstract = {In Sorghum bicolor, a group of phytoalexins are induced at the site of infection by Colletotrichum sublineolum, the anthracnose fungus. These compounds, classified as 3-deoxyanthocyanidins, have structural similarities to the precursors of phlobaphenes. Sorghum yellow seed1 (y1) encodes a MYB transcription factor that regulates phlobaphene biosynthesis. Using the candystripe1 transposon mutagenesis system in sorghum, we have isolated functional revertants as well as loss-of-function alleles of y1. These near-isogenic lines of sorghum show that, compared to functionally revertant alleles, loss of y1 lines do not accumulate phlobaphenes. Molecular characterization of two null y1 alleles shows a partial internal deletion in the y1 sequence. These null alleles, designated as y1-ww1 and y1-ww4, do not accumulate 3-deoxyanthocyanidins when challenged with the nonpathogenic fungus Cochliobolus heterostrophus. Further, as compared to the wild-type allele, both y1-ww1 and y1-ww4 show greater susceptibility to the pathogenic fungus C. sublineolum. In fungal-inoculated wild-type seedlings, y1 and its target flavonoid structural genes are coordinately expressed. However, in y1-ww1 and y1-ww4 seedlings where y1 is not expressed, steady-state transcripts of its target genes could not be detected. Cosegregation analysis showed that the functional y1 gene is genetically linked with resistance to C. sublineolum. Overall results demonstrate that the accumulation of sorghum 3-deoxyanthocyanidin phytoalexins and resistance to C. sublineolum in sorghum require a functional y1 gene.},

@article{stitt_steps_2002,
abstract = {This article discusses how nitrate assimilation is integrated with nitrate uptake, with ammonium assimilation and amino acid synthesis, with pH regulation, and with the sugar supply in tobacco leaves. During the first part of the light period, nitrate assimilation exceeds nitrate uptake by 2‐fold and ammonium assimilation by 50{\%}, leading to rapid depletion of nitrate and accumulation of ammonium, glutamine, glycine and serine. NIA, NII and PPC expression show a shared maximum early in the diurnal cycle to direct carbon towards malate synthesis for pH regulation. Later in the diurnal cycle an orchestrated increase of GLN2, PKc, CS, and ICDH‐1 expression re‐establishes a balance between nitrate assimilation and ammonium metabolism. Nitrate uptake continues throughout the night, replenishing the leaf nitrate pool. These diurnal changes are attenuated or abolished in mutants with low NIA activity, and modified in wild‐type plants growing on different nitrogen sources or elevated [CO2]. Comparison across genotypes and conditions reveals that NIA transcript levels are always closely related to the balance between nitrate influx and assimilation, but are unrelated to changes of glutamine or 2‐oxoglutarate. In a systematic search for other downstream regulators, a wide range of downstream metabolites was fed to detached leaves and glutamate, cysteine, asparagine, and malate identified as candidates. Low sugars totally inhibit nitrate assimilation, overriding signals from nitrogen metabolism. Moderate changes act post‐transcriptionally, and larger changes lead to a collapse of the NIA transcript. Low sugars also lead to a collapse of minor amino acids and a dramatic decrease of phenylpropanoids and nicotine. Consequently, wild‐type plants growing in unfavourable light regimes and antisense RBCS transformants are simultaneously carbon‐ and nitrogen‐limited.},

We predict 46,430 protein-coding genes, 70{\%} more than Arabidopsis and similar to the poplar genome which, like soybean, is an ancient polyploid (palaeopolyploid). About 78{\%} of the predicted genes occur in chromosome ends, which comprise less than one-half of the genome but account for nearly all of the genetic recombination. Genome duplications occurred at approximately 59 and 13 million years ago, resulting in a highly duplicated genome with nearly 75{\%} of the genes present in multiple copies. The two duplication events were followed by gene diversification and loss, and numerous chromosome rearrangements. An accurate soybean genome sequence will facilitate the identification of the genetic basis of many soybean traits, and accelerate the creation of improved soybean varieties.},

abstract = {Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] breeders can sometimes increase genetic variability in their germplasm through wide crosses with plant introduction (PI) material, and in that way lead to slow progress in developing high-yielding cultivars. A study was conducted to evaluate the potential of crosses of adapted × introduced soybean lines for improving yield and protein and oil concentrations. Five soybean cultivars adapted to South Dakota were crossed in selected combinations with four PI lines to develop F3-derived lines. The adapted and PI lines were selected for wide variation in protein and oil concentration. Thirty F3:5 lines and parents from each of eight different crosses, including two adapted × adapted, were evaluated in a replicated group balanced block experiment. Significant genetic variability for yield occurred among progenies of two adapted × PI crosses, and for protein and oil concentrations among progenies of two adapted × PI crosses. No significant genetic variability for any trait was found among progenies of adapted × adapted crosses. Progenies of adapted × adapted crosses generally yielded more seed and had higher oil concentrations than those from adapted × PI crosses. PI parents with high trait expression produced populations with high expression for that trait, and combined better with some adapted parents than with others. With single-trait selection, simultaneous improvement of yield and oil concentration was more successful than for yield and protein concentration, or for protein and oil. Increases in the sum of protein and oil concentrations were small, and were achieved through increased protein concentration. In addition to measuring the trait of interest before crossing with PI lines, it seems that genetic variability of populations and combining ability of adapted parents should be determined. Relationships of yield, protein, and oil should be determined for each cross, even if only one trait is of interest in the selection program.},

abstract = {Pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) is one of the oldest and important horticultural plants in Iran. Pomegranate fruits are an important source of secondary metabolites such as phenolic compounds, tannins, colors and alkaloids. Anthocyanin accumulation in plant organs is associated with gene expression in anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway. Regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis expression is controlled by a number of transcription factors including MYB, basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH) and WD-repeat protein (WD-Repeat) proteins. In order to study the expression level of some transcription factors/genes and their role in pomegranate skin color, real time PCR analysis was used to assess the expression patterns among different pomegranate genotypes. Results of this study showed that white and green skin genotypes had the highest AN1 (bHLH) expression, whereas bright red and black skin genotypes accumulated the lowest AN1 transcript level. Furthermore, green and bright red genotypes showed the highest and the lowest expression level with regard to AN2 (MYB) transcription factor, respectively. The DFR gene expression in samples with black skin was the highest while in white skin samples the lowest expression of this gene was shown. This result indicates the influence of WD40 transcription factor on DFR structural gene and its effective role on synthesis of skin color. With regard to expression of three transcription factors in all genotypes, it was evident that MYB–bHLH–WD40 complex confers the skin color in pomegranate. Total anthocyanin content measurement showed a positive correlation between the level of DFR gene expression and accumulation of anthocyaninsin different genotypes.},

abstract = {In Multivariate Statistical Process Control, when a fault is expected or detected in the process, contribution plots are essential for operators and optimization engineers in identifying those process variables that were affected by or might be the cause of the fault. The traditional way of interpreting a contribution plot is to examine the largest contributing process variables as the most probable faulty ones. This might result in false readings purely due to the differences in natural variation, measurement uncertainties, etc. It is more reasonable to compare variable contributions for new process runs with historical results achieved under Normal Operating Conditions, where confidence limits for contribution plots estimated from training data are used to judge new production runs. Asymptotic methods cannot provide confidence limits for contribution plots, leaving re-sampling methods as the only option. We suggest bootstrap re-sampling to build confidence limits for all contribution plots in online PCA-based MSPC. The new strategy to estimate CLs is compared to the previously reported CLs for contribution plots. An industrial batch process dataset was used to illustrate the concepts.},

Comparative genomics showed that the euchromatic regions between rice and maize are very conserved. Physically we delimited these conserved regions and thus detected many genome rearrangements. We defined extensively the duplication blocks within the maize genome. These blocks allowed us to reconstruct the chromosomes of the maize progenitor.

The core structures of DRAs are formed in secondary (i.e. specialized) metabolism via cycloisomerization of geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) by diterpene synthases (diTPSs). Previously described gymnosperm diTPSs of DRA biosynthesis are bifunctional enzymes that catalyze the initial bicyclization of GGPP followed by rearrangement of a (+)-copalyl diphosphate intermediate at two discrete class II and class I active sites. In contrast, similar diterpenes of gibberellin primary (i.e. general) metabolism are produced by the consecutive activity of two monofunctional class II and class I diTPSs. Using high-throughput transcriptome sequencing, we discovered 11 diTPS from jack pine (Pinus banksiana) and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta). Three of these were orthologous to known conifer bifunctional levopimaradiene/abietadiene synthases. Surprisingly, two sets of orthologous PbdiTPSs and PcdiTPSs were monofunctional class I enzymes that lacked functional class II active sites and converted (+)-copalyl diphosphate, but not GGPP, into isopimaradiene and pimaradiene as major products. Diterpene profiles and transcriptome sequences of lodgepole pine and jack pine are consistent with roles for these diTPSs in DRA biosynthesis. The monofunctional class I diTPSs of DRA biosynthesis form a new clade within the gymnosperm-specific TPS-d3 subfamily that evolved from bifunctional diTPS rather than monofunctional enzymes (TPS-c and TPS-e) of gibberellin metabolism. Homology modeling suggested alterations in the class I active site that may have contributed to their functional specialization relative to other conifer diTPSs.},

abstract = {The construction industry in China exerts significant environmental impacts and uses considerable resources because of rapid urbanization. This study conducted a structural path analysis (SPA) based on the multi-regional input–output table to quantify environmental impact transmission in the entire supply chain. Results indicated that the direct resource input (the first stage) along with on-site construction (the zeroth stage) consumed the highest amount of energy in the supply chain and accounted for approximately 50{\%} of total energy consumption. Regional analysis showed that energy consumption in the construction industry at the provincial level was self-sufficient. Sectoral analysis demonstrated that the direct inputs from the sectors of “manufacture of non-metallic mineral products” and “smelting and pressing of metals” generated the most important energy flows, whereas the sectors of “production and distribution of electric power and heat power” and “extraction of petroleum and natural gas” significantly but indirectly influenced energy use. Sensitivity analysis exhibited that the system boundary of SPA could be narrowed down into the first two upstream stages that contained nearly 50{\%} of energy flow information or expanded toward the first five upstream stages that represented 80{\%} of total energy consumption.},

abstract = {Cultivars have to be evaluated under different crop management systems across agro-ecosystems and years using multi-environment trials (MET) before releasing them to the market. Frequently, data collected in METs are arranged according to cultivar (G), management (M), location, (L) and year (Y) combinations in a four-way G x M x L x Y data table that is highly unbalanced for cultivars across locations and time. Therefore, we present the restricted maximum likelihood method (REML) for linear mixed models (LMM) with a factor analytic variance-covariance matrix for assessing cultivar adaptation to crop management systems and environments based on unbalanced datasets. Such a multi-environmental trial system has been in operation in Poland for winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in the form of the Post-registration Variety Testing System (PVTS). This study aimed to illustrate the use of LMM in the analysis of unbalanced four-way G x M x L x Y data. LMM analysis provided adjusted means of grain yield for 51 winter wheat cultivars bred in different regions in Europe, tested across 18 trial locations and seven consecutive cropping seasons in two crop management intensities. The application of the four-way LMM with a factor analytic variance-covariance matrix is a complementary and effective tool for evaluating the unbalanced G x M x L x Y table. Cultivars tested had different adaptive responses to the Polish agro-ecosystems separately for each of the crop management intensities. Wide adaptation in both crop management systems was exhibited by cultivars Mulan and Jenga bred in Germany.Key words: crop management; restricted maximum likelihood methods; unbalanced data; winter wheat},

This poly(A)-rich RNA is efficiently translated in a nuclease-treated extract of rabbit reticulocytes. By sucrose density gradient fractionation of bulk poly(A)-rich RNA from wheat germ, it has been possible to show that there is a direct relationship between the molecular weights of the polypeptide products of cell-free synthesis and the molecular weights of the wheat mRNA molecules which program their synthesis. As assessed by SDS -- polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the same array of polypeptides is synthesized when nuclease-treated reticulocyte extract is programmed by poly(A)-rich RNA from either commercially supplied or laboratory-prepared wheat embryos. Significantly, there are gross quantitative if not qualitative differences between the translational capacities of poly(A)-rich RNA from dry and imbibing wheat embryos, and the possible importance of these differences for interpreting a changing pattern of polypeptide synthesis in imbibing wheat embryos is the subject of a brief discussion.},

abstract = {Regression tends to give very unstable and unreliable regression weights when predictors are highly collinear. Several methods have been proposed to counter this problem. A subset of these do so by finding components that summarize the information in the predictors and the criterion variables. The present paper compares six such methods (two of which are almost completely new) to ordinary regression: Partial least Squares (PLS), Principal Component regression (PCR), Principle covariates regression, reduced rank regression, and two variants of what is called power regression. The comparison is mainly done by means of a series of simulation studies, in which data are constructed in various ways, with different degrees of collinearity and noise, and the methods are compared in terms of their capability of recovering the population regression weights, as well as their prediction quality for the complete population. It turns out that recovery of regression weights in situations with collinearity is often very poor by all methods, unless the regression weights lie in the subspace spanning the first few principal components of the predictor variables. In those cases, typically PLS and PCR give the best recoveries of regression weights. The picture is inconclusive, however, because, especially in the study with more real life like simulated data, PLS and PCR gave the poorest recoveries of regression weights in conditions with relatively low noise and collinearity. It seems that PLS and PCR are particularly indicated in cases with much collinearity, whereas in other cases it is better to use ordinary regression. As far as prediction is concerned: Prediction suffers far less from collinearity than recovery of the regression weights.},

@article{_sulphur_2016-1,
abstract = {Deficiency of sulphur (S) has been recognised as a limiting factor for crop production in many regions in the world. In particular, incidence of S deficiency has increasingly been reported in Brassica and cereal crops in Western Europe over the last decade, mainly as a consequence of a massive decrease of atmospheric S inputs. The S requirement of wheat is about 15–20 kg/ha for optimum growth. Reproductive growth of wheat appears to be more sensitive to S deficiency than vegetative growth, with decreased grain size under S-limiting conditions. In addition to the effects on yields, the S status of wheat grain is an important parameter for the quality of wheat products. Limiting S availability has been shown to favour the synthesis and accumulation of S-poor or low-S storage proteins such as $\omega$-gliadin and high molecular weight (HMW) subunits of glutenin at the expense of S-rich proteins. Sulphur deficiency also decreases the proportion of polymeric proteins in total proteins, but shifts the distribution of polymeric proteins toward lower molecular weight. These changes in protein composition are associated with alterations of dough rheology. Significant responses of breadmaking quality to the addition of S fertilisers have been established under field conditions. Recent studies have also shown that breadmaking quality correlated more closely with grain S concentration than with N concentration. Recent progress in cloning genes encoding components involved in sulphate uptake and assimilation has substantially increased our understanding of plant S nutrition and its regulation, and opened up opportunities for manipulation of S uptake and metabolism in plants.},

abstract = {Agricultural simulation models are increasingly being used in decision support tools at regional and national scales for crop production and water management. These models require hydrologic inputs; in particular plant available water (PAW) is a critical parameter that helps determine if precipitation infiltrates and is stored as soil water, is lost directly to the atmosphere through soil evaporation, or is transported as groundwater flow. Accurate or realistic estimations of PAW for many geographic regions and soil types must be readily available as model input for simulating crop growth and many downstream processes, such as water quality, soil erosion, sediment loss, nutrient/pesticide fate and transport, and greenhouse gas emissions. In this study, we present a new algorithm for PAW estimation, termed the BNW algorithm, which was developed primarily based on principles of soil properties. The new BNW algorithm outperformed several commonly used algorithms for overall soil pedon fit and by USDA texture class. The BNW algorithm has the best fit and accuracy on sandy clay and sandy clay loam soils. Incorporation of the BNW algorithm into process based simulation models will improve the accuracy of crop production estimates and environmental impacts estimates at regional and national scales.},

abstract = {How complex does a model need to be to provide useful predictions is a matter of continuous debate across environmental sciences. In the species distributions modelling literature, studies have demonstrated that more complex models tend to provide better fits. However, studies have also shown that predictive performance does not always increase with complexity. Testing of species distributions models is challenging because independent data for testing are often lacking, but a more general problem is that model complexity has never been formally described in such studies. Here, we systematically examine predictive performance of models against data and models of varying complexity. We introduce the concept of computational complexity, widely used in theoretical computer sciences, to quantify model complexity. In addition, complexity of species distributional data is characterized by their geometrical properties. Tests involved analysis of models' ability to predict virtual species distributions in the same region and the same time as used for training the models, and to project distributions in different times under climate change. Of the eight species distribution models analyzed five (Random Forest, boosted regression trees, generalized additive models, multivariate adaptive regression splines, MaxEnt) showed similar performance despite differences in computational complexity. The ability of models to forecast distributions under climate change was also not affected by model complexity. In contrast, geometrical characteristics of the data were related to model performance in several ways: complex datasets were consistently more difficult to model, and the complexity of the data was affected by the choice of predictors and the type of data analyzed. Given our definition of complexity, our study contradicts the widely held view that the complexity of species distributions models has significant effects in their predictive ability while findings support for previous observations that the properties of species distributions data and their relationship with the environment are strong predictors of model success.},

abstract = {Irrigated rice contributes the most to rice production globally and in most of rice producing countries. As with other rice production ecosystems, genotype and growing environment are the main factors influencing grain yield (GY) in irrigated rice production. However, the relative importance of genotype, environment and genotype-by-environment interaction (GEI) on GY is less studied for irrigated rice, although evaluation of candidate varieties for yield stability through multi-environment trials before release and registration is mandatory in many countries. To identify patterns of genotype, environment, and GEI for GY of irrigated lowland rice, 392 cultivars or advanced breeding lines mostly from the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), PhilRice (Philippines) and a few breeding programs of other countries were evaluated for GY and related traits in eight environments including Jiangxi (JX) and Sichuan (SC) in China, and six season (2) and nitrogen rate (3) combinations at IRRI headquarters (Los Ba{\~{n}}os, Philippines). Wide ranges of variations across genotypes and environments were observed for all traits. Genotype, environment, and GEI all significantly affected GY and some of the yield associated traits. GEI was more important than genotypic main effect for GY, seed setting rate and the number of panicles per plant but less important for other traits. For GY, the genotype-by-season interaction and genotype-by-season-by-nitrogen interaction was more important than the genotype-by-nitrogen interaction. The 303 genotypes with GY data in all environments were clustered into ten groups based on GY using an agglomerative hierarchical clustering procedure. The eight environments were grouped into three groups based GY using the additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) analysis. Three nitrogen rates in the WS and SC were grouped together (E1), while three nitrogen rates in the DS formed another group (E2). JX alone was the third group (E3). Genotype groups GG9 and GG3 had the highest GY across the eight testing environments. GG9 had the highest yield in E1 and E2 while GG10 was the best in E3.},

abstract = {Jasmonate and related signalling compounds have a crucial role in both host immunity and development in plants, but the molecular details of the signalling mechanism are poorly understood. Here we identify members of the jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) protein family as key regulators of jasmonate signalling. JAZ1 protein acts to repress transcription of jasmonate-responsive genes. Jasmonate treatment causes JAZ1 degradation and this degradation is dependent on activities of the SCFCOI1 ubiquitin ligase and the 26S proteasome. Furthermore, the jasmonoyl–isoleucine (JA–Ile) conjugate, but not other jasmonate-derivatives such as jasmonate, 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid, or methyl-jasmonate, promotes physical interaction between COI1 and JAZ1 proteins in the absence of other plant proteins. Our results suggest a model in which jasmonate ligands promote the binding of the SCFCOI1 ubiquitin ligase to and subsequent degradation of the JAZ1 repressor protein, and implicate the SCFCOI1–JAZ1 protein complex as a site of perception of the plant hormone JA–Ile.},

abstract = {Mixed-species forests can sometimes fulfil forest functions and services better than monocultures and are therefore receiving growing attention in forest science and practice. The productivity of mixtures and the interactions between species are influenced by the availability of different resources and climatic conditions, all of which change spatially and temporally. Models are a valuable tool for understanding and predicting how these interacting factors will influence the growth and other functions and services in mixed-species forests. However, concepts, models and theory are still mainly based on monocultures, which have dominated forest science since its beginnings. Recent empirical works report strong effects of mixing tree species on the environmental conditions within stands (e.g., vertical light profile, rooting space, humus layer), their functioning (e.g., photosynthetic rate, light use, growth), and tree and stand structure (e.g., crown and stem shape, shoot and root morphology). Process-based organ- or tree-level approaches reveal changed resource supply, flows and metabolic rates in high spatial and temporal resolution. Stand-level approaches usually provide predictions with a lower spatial and temporal resolution but can be more accurate in the longer-term. Many studies stress considerable effects of mixing tree species on growth dynamics, yield, resilience and stability, but these effects are still under-represented in existing models. We reviewed 54 forest growth models to show how they incorporate the variability of individual tree or species characteristics that occur in forests and how this variability influences the development and characteristics of the whole stand. While some organ- or tree-level models inherently integrate evident processes, stand-level models do not usually explicitly consider species interactions. Nevertheless, many processes that occur in mixtures can also be modelled at the stand level and are often included in stand-level monospecific models. Stand-level models are likely to offer a simpler alternative model structure for mixtures. We stress how both model approaches can be refined, benefit from mutual adjustment, and can be substantiated by further empirical research into mixed-species forests.},

The entire procedure can be carried out in approximately 10 minutes; it is efficient, reproducible, and free from deleterious manipulations. The wet tissue is homogenized with a mixture of chloroform and methanol in such proportions that a miscible system is formed with the water in the tissue. Dilution with chloroform and water separates the homogenate into two layers, the chloroform layer containing all the lipids and the methanolic layer containing all the non-lipids. A purified lipid extract is obtained merely by isolating the chloroform layer. The method has been applied to fish muscle and may easily be adapted to use with other tissues., non disponible},

abstract = {Willow is an important biomass crop for the bioenergy industry, and therefore optimal growth with minimal effects of biotic and abiotic stress is essential. The phenylpropanoid pathway is responsible for the biosynthesis of not only lignin but also of flavonoids, condensed tannins, benzenoids and phenolic glycosides which all have a role in protecting the plant against biotic and abiotic stress. All products of the phenylpropanoid pathway are important for the healthy growth of short rotation cropping species such as willow. However, the phenylpropanoid pathway in willow remains largely uncharacterised. In the current study we identified and characterised five willow phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) genes, which encode enzymes that catalyse the deamination of l-phenylalanine to form trans-cinnamic acid, the entry point into the phenylpropanoid pathway. Willow PAL1, PAL2, PAL3 and PAL4 genes were orthologous to the poplar genes. However no orthologue of PAL5 appears to be present in willow. Moreover, two tandemly repeated PAL2 orthologues were identified in a single contig. Willow PALs show similar sub-cellular localisation to the poplar genes. However, the enzyme kinetics and gene expression of the willow PAL genes differed slightly, with willow PAL2 being more widely expressed than its poplar orthologues implying a wider role for PALs in the production of flavonoids, condensed tannins, benzenoids, and phenolic glycosides, in willow.},

Results indicated that cultivar had a more significant effect on the analyzed parameters than harvesting date. Thus grouping of the variables in a PCA plot indicated that each cultivar has specific characteristics important for consumer or industrial use. Cultivar ‘Monterey' was the richest in phytochemical contents and consequently in antioxidant activity, ‘Albion' showed the highest contents of total soluble solids, titratable acidity content and ascorbic acid, ‘Capri' had the highest value of firmness, while ‘Murano' had lighter color in comparison to others.

abstract = {The aim of this work has been to evaluate the anti-staling effect exerted by a novel $\alpha$-amylase-lipase enzyme formulation on durum wheat bread, in comparison with four different commercial amylase preparations and with control without added enzymes. Bread-making trials were carried out at industrial level. Sliced bread, packed under modified atmosphere, was analyzed for texture profile, moisture content, and water activity during 90 days. Crumb sections were submitted to environmental scanning electron microscopy at the end of the storage period. The $\alpha$-amylase-lipase enzyme preparation showed synergistic interactions in preventing staling. In particular, bread added of these two enzymes in mixture was always softer and more chewable than either control or samples added of other enzymes. Moreover, $\alpha$-amylase-lipase exhibited the most marked effect in slowing down both hardening and chewiness changes during time. Starting from 7 days of storage, both water activity and moisture content of bread added of $\alpha$-amylase-lipase were higher than in control. Starting from 68 days the moisture content of $\alpha$-amylase-lipase-added bread became lower than that of other enzyme-added breads, and at the end of storage also water activity was significantly lower. Pore morphology of $\alpha$-amylase-lipase-added bread appeared markedly different from that of control bread.},

Strigolactones are compounds thought to be derived from carotenoids and are known to trigger the germination of parasitic plant seeds and stimulate symbiotic fungi. Here we present evidence that carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 8 shoot branching mutants of pea are strigolactone deficient and that strigolactone application restores the wild-type branching phenotype to ccd8 mutants. Moreover, we show that other branching mutants previously characterized as lacking a response to the branching inhibition signal also lack strigolactone response, and are not deficient in strigolactones. These responses are conserved in Arabidopsis. In agreement with the expected properties of the hormonal signal, exogenous strigolactone can be transported in shoots and act at low concentrations. We suggest that endogenous strigolactones or related compounds inhibit shoot branching in plants. Furthermore, ccd8 mutants demonstrate the diverse effects of strigolactones in shoot branching, mycorrhizal symbiosis and parasitic weed interaction.},

The morphological, mechanical, and electromagnetic properties of the lignin-based carbon nanofibers are presented. The strength of lignin random nanofiber mats was significantly improved after carbonization and alignment. By doping the lignin polymer with carbon nanotubes and functional nanoparticles such as magnetite, it was possible to improve the strength and introduce electromagnetic functionality to the lignin nanofiber assemblies. These encouraging results demonstrate the potential of lignin-based composite carbon nanofibers as a unique engineering material, thus establishing a pathway for adding value to the abundantly available natural polymer, lignin.},

abstract = {Plants produce a wide array of natural products, many of which are likely to be useful bioactive structures. Unfortunately, these complex natural products usually occur at very low abundance and with restricted tissue distribution, thereby hindering their evaluation. Here, we report a novel approach for enhancing the accumulation of natural products based on activation tagging by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation with a T-DNA that carries cauliflower mosaic virus 35S enhancer sequences at its right border. Among approximately 5000 Arabidopsis activation-tagged lines, we found a plant that exhibited intense purple pigmentation in many vegetative organs throughout development. This upregulation of pigmentation reflected a dominant mutation that resulted in massive activation of phenylpropanoid biosynthetic genes and enhanced accumulation of lignin, hydroxycinnamic acid esters, and flavonoids, including various anthocyanins that were responsible for the purple color. These phenotypes, caused by insertion of the viral enhancer sequences adjacent to an MYB transcription factor gene, indicate that activation tagging can overcome the stringent genetic controls regulating the accumulation of specific natural products during plant development. Our findings suggest a functional genomics approach to the biotechnological evaluation of phytochemical biodiversity through the generation of massively enriched tissue sources for drug screening and for isolating underlying regulatory and biosynthetic genes.},

Across-site subrace (ˆrsrˆs{\{}$\backslash$textbackslash{\}}widehat{\{}r{\}}{\_}{\{}s{\}}) and family (ˆrfrˆf{\{}$\backslash$textbackslash{\}}widehat{\{}r{\}}{\_}{\{}f{\}}) correlations were estimated by linear mixed model analyses of pairs of trials.

These were then averaged for each of four states (Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia) and across all sites. Statistically significant G × E interaction was detected, and weighted means across states for ˆrsrˆs{\{}$\backslash$textbackslash{\}}widehat{\{}r{\}}{\_}{\{}s{\}} and ˆrfrˆf{\{}$\backslash$textbackslash{\}}widehat{\{}r{\}}{\_}{\{}f{\}} were 0.73 and 0.76, respectively. Nevertheless, the three subraces from the Otway Ranges were both fast growing and relatively stable in their ranks over all sites. We evaluated the sensitivity of subraces to changing environmental conditions, on the basis of random coefficient models regressing subrace performance on selected trial climatic variables. The results suggested differential susceptibility of subraces to water, light and (to a less extent) temperature stresses during summer. Moreover, using multivariate techniques to visualize and interpret the across-site correlation structure for subrace effects, we could identify site clusters of reduced G × E interaction related to soil water availability and evaporative demand during summer. A revised site-type classification using these factors should allow a better capture of genetic gains from breeding and deployment.},

To do this, data on 16 treatments (combination of 2 cultivars [Albion and Camarosa], 2 origins [National and Imported] , and 4 organic substrates mixed [70{\%} crushed sugar cane residue + 30{\%} organic compost, 70{\%} crushed sugar cane residue + 30{\%} commercial substrate, 70{\%} burnt rice husk + 30{\%} organic compost, and 70{\%} burnt rice husk + 30{\%} commercial substrate]) conducted in a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with 4 replicates were used. Different parameterizations of the Logistic, Gompertz, and von Bertalanffy models were adjusted for number and weight of fruits per plant (g) accumulated in multiple harvests. The model adjustment and parameter estimation were obtained by ordinary least squares, using a Gauss Newton algorithm. The selection of the best model was chosen by intrinsic and parametric nonlinearity. Among the adjusted nonlinear models, the best adjustment for both variables was achieved by the parameterization 2 of the Logistic model and parameterization 1 of the Gompertz model, because they had lower results with less parametric and intrinsic nonlinearity. However, care should be taken when using the Gompertz model because it tends to overestimate the production estimate and may cause misunderstandings in interpretation.},

The analysed components included macronutrients, individual profiles of sugars and fatty acids by chromatographic techniques, hydrophilic antioxidants such as vitamin C, phenolics, flavonols and anthocyanins, and lipophilic antioxidants such as tocopherols, $\beta$-carotene and lycopene. Furthermore, the antioxidant activity was evaluated through DPPH scavenging activity, reducing power, $\beta$-carotene bleaching inhibition and TBARS formation inhibition. One of the four varieties, which is locally known as round tomato or potato tomato, proved to be the most powerful in antioxidant activity (EC50 values ⩽ 1.63 mg/ml), phenolic compounds (phenolics 31.23 mg ClAE/g extract, flavonols 6.36 mg QE/g extract and anthocyanins 3.45 mg ME/g extract) and carotenoids ($\beta$-carotene 0.51 mg/100 g and lycopene 9.49 mg/100 g), while the so-called yellow tomato variety revealed interesting nutritional composition, including higher fructose (3.42 g/100 g), glucose (3.18 g/100 g), $\alpha$-linolenic acid (15.53{\%}) and total tocopherols (1.44 mg/100 g) levels. Overall, these farmer' varieties of garden tomato cultivated in the Northeastern Portuguese region could contribute as sources of important antioxidants related to the prevention of chronic diseases associated to oxidative stress, such as cancer and coronary artery disease .},

@article{kahiluoto_cultivating_2014,
abstract = {Intensified climate and market turbulence requires resilience to a multitude of changes. Diversity reduces the sensitivity to disturbance and fosters the capacity to adapt to various future scenarios. What really matters is diversity of responses. Despite appeals to manage resilience, conceptual developments have not yet yielded a break-through in empirical applications. Here, we present an approach to empirically reveal the ‘response diversity': the factors of change that are critical to a system are identified, and the response diversity is determined based on the documented component responses to these factors. We illustrate this approach and its added value using an example of securing food supply in the face of climate variability and change. This example demonstrates that quantifying response diversity allows for a new perspective: despite continued increase in cultivar diversity of barley, the diversity in responses to weather declined during the last decade in the regions where most of the barley is grown in Finland. This was due to greater homogeneity in responses among new cultivars than among older ones. Such a decline in the response diversity indicates increased vulnerability and reduced resilience. The assessment serves adaptive management in the face of both ecological and socio-economic drivers. Supplier diversity in the food retail industry in order to secure affordable food in spite of global price volatility could represent another application. The approach is, indeed, applicable to any system for which it is possible to adopt empirical information regarding the response by its components to the critical factors of variability and change. Targeting diversification in response to critical change brings efficiency into diversity. We propose the generic procedure that is demonstrated in this study as a means to efficiently enhance resilience at multiple levels of agrifood systems and beyond.},

abstract = {Leaves provide substances and signals for pod and seed development in soybean. However, the regulatory feedbacks of pod and seed on leaf development remain unclear. Here, we investigated the effects of pod/seed on leaf senescence by conducting pod removal and seed injury experiments. Our results showed that pod removal and seed injury delayed leaf senescence and caused the stay green phenotype of leaves. There were dosage effects of pod number on the extent of stay green in the depodded plants. The concentrations of chlorophyll (SPAD value, the index of relative chlorophyll content), soluble protein, and soluble sugar in the leaves of depodded plants were higher than those of intact plants. During seed development, the content of IAA decreased while that of ABA increased. This trend was more pronounced in the intact plants compared with the depodded and seed-injured ones. The ratio of GA3/ABA decreased gradually in all treatments. The content of GA3 was relatively stable, and it was higher in the intact plants than in the depodded plants. The expression levels of the four senescence-related genes, GmSARK, GmSGR1, GmCYN1 and GmNAC, declined in the depodded or seed-injured treatments and were positively correlated with the number of leaves retained in the plants. GmFT2a, the major flowering promoting gene, was expressed at a higher level while E1, a key flowering inhibitory gene, was expressed at a lower level in depodded plants than in intact plants. We postulated that pod or seed can regulate leaf development. When the seed is aborted due to disease infection or pest attack, the leaves stay green because of the absence of the seed signals for senescence.},

Nevertheless, dietary fibre makes up less than half of wheat bran. Other nutrients and phytochemicals are present in wheat bran, some of which may also protect against cancer. These include phytic acid and various phenolic components such as phenolic acids, lignans and flavonoids.

abstract = {Nitrogen (N) is the main mineral element in plant tissues and almost all of this nutrient is acquired from the soil by the roots. Nitrogen is available in many different forms in the soil, but the three most abundant forms are nitrate, ammonium and amino acids. The relative importance of these different soil N pools to a plant is difficult to measure and depends on many different environmental factors. Changes in the available amounts and imbalance in the supply of some N forms can even be toxic to plants and in extreme cases can lead to changes in the vegetation. However, the importance of this element for agriculture is reflected in the amounts of N-fertiliser applied to crops and this is a major cost (economic and environmental) for world agriculture. This review covers the molecular mechanisms that the plant uses for accessing these soil N pools and briefly includes consideration of the root N assimilatory pathways that exist in the plant. The soil forms of N that are used by plants depend on many factors, but a series of different transporter and assimilatory genes that can provide access to these pools have been identified. This information can now provide the molecular tools to identify the N sources accessed by a plant and the relative importance of these different pools.},

abstract = {Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is a major crop plant and a model system for fruit development. Solanum is one of the largest angiosperm genera and includes annual and perennial plants from diverse habitats. Here we present a high-quality genome sequence of domesticated tomato, a draft sequence of its closest wild relative, Solanum pimpinellifolium, and compare them to each other and to the potato genome (Solanum tuberosum). The two tomato genomes show only 0.6{\%} nucleotide divergence and signs of recent admixture, but show more than 8{\%} divergence from potato, with nine large and several smaller inversions. In contrast to Arabidopsis, but similar to soybean, tomato and potato small RNAs map predominantly to gene-rich chromosomal regions, including gene promoters. The Solanum lineage has experienced two consecutive genome triplications: one that is ancient and shared with rosids, and a more recent one. These triplications set the stage for the neofunctionalization of genes controlling fruit characteristics, such as colour and fleshiness.},

@article{nose_towards_1995-3,
abstract = {When Pinus taeda cell suspension cultures are exposed to 8{\%} sucrose solution, the cells undergo significant intracellular disruption, irregular wall thickening/lignification with concomitant formation of an 'extracellular lignin precipitate. However, addition of potassium iodide (KI), an H202 scavenger, inhibits this lignification response, while the ability to synthesize the monolignols, p-coumaryl and coniferyl alcohols, is retained. Lignin synthesis (i.e. polymerization) is thus temporarily correlated with H202 generation, strongly implying a regulatory role for the latter. Time course analyses of extracellular metabolites leading up to polymer formation reveal that coniferyl alcohol, but not p-coumaryl alcohol, undergoes substantial coupling reactions to give various lignans. Of these, the metabolites, dihydrodehydrodiconiferyl alcohol, shonanin (divanillyl tetrahydrofuran) and its apparent aryl tetralin derivative, cannot be explained simply on the basis of phenolic coupling. It is proposed that these moieties are the precursors of so-called reduced substructures in the lignin macromolecule. This adds a new perspective to the lignin assembly mechanism.},

@article{hu_measurement_2016,
abstract = {In practice, many estimation problems rely on on-line solutions, hence recusive methods are necessary. Tradition estimation approaches for linear systems subject to Gaussian noise are based on the Kalman filter and its improving algorithms. Based on the realization construction of state prediction and measurement update, Kalman filter can obtain the optimal estimation of state under the linear minimum variance criterion. However, it is known that the optimal filtering result is achieved in statistical sense, which can not meet a superior result for single filtering process because of the random characteristics effect of measurement noise. Aiming at this problem, the authors propose a novel Kalman filtering algorithm based on measurement bootstrapping strategy. In realization of algorithm, first, combining with the extraction and utilization of measurement information including the latest measurement and the prior statistical information from measurement noise modeling, the measurement bootstrapping strategy is designed and virtual measurements are sampled. Its objective is to enhance the reliability of latest measurement by increasing samples numbers. Second, virtual measurements are applied to Kalman filtering framework, and the key improvement is concentrated in the utilization of measurement information. In addition, considering the requirements in engineering application such as instantaneity, filtering precision and robustness, the distributed weighted fusion structure and the centralized consistency fusion structure are designed respectively. Finally, the theoretical analysis and experimental results verify the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.},

@article{yao_heritability_2000,
abstract = {Most traits of interest in hazelnut are quantitative, yet there is little information available on heritability, variance components, or correlations. In this study, 13 morphological and four phenological traits were observed for 3 years on 41 parental genotypes, and for 2 years on seed-lings representing 35 progenies. Narrow-sense heritability estimates obtained by regression of offspring means on midparent values were all high, ranging from 0.56 for amount of kernel fibre to 0.89 for nut depth. Data on the parent genotypes was used to analyse variance components and showed that genotypic variance accounted for most of the phenotypic variance for all traits, and there was very little variation among trees within genotypes. Genotype-year interaction accounted for only a very small part of the phenotypic variance for most traits, and changes in genotype rank were few and minor. Thus, selection based on genotype means is appropriate. The largest genotype-year interaction components were observed for time of nut maturity, time of stigma exsertion, time of catkin elongation, number of nuts per cluster and amount of kernel fibre. For these five traits, evaluation over a period of years is advised. Correlation coefficients were large and positive for four nut size traits, indicating some redundancy in these measurements. Three of the phenological traits (time of stigma exsertion, time of catkin elongation, and time of leaf budbreak) were also highly and positively correlated. A large genetic correlation (0.44 {\{}{\textless}{\}} r {\{}{\textless}{\}} 0.73) was noted between good blanching and early phenology (catkin elongation, stigma exsertion and leaf budbreak), although plots of individual seedling values showed a large degree of scattering. Genetic correlations also indicated that seedlings with small nuts also tend to have compressed nuts, short husks and catkins that elongate later, but plots of individual seedling values showed large scattering. Correlations among the six traits directly related to the objectives of the Oregon State University hazelnut breeding programme (kernel weight, per cent kernel, nut shape index, blanching ability, relative husk length and nut maturity) were very low, indicating that they can be handled as independent traits.},

A subpopulation of cambial cells—the fusiform initials—are elongated and capable of coordinated reorientation in response to internal and external stimuli. Changes in the orientation of fusiform initials in turn leads to changes in the grain pattern of developing wood. This article reviews the phenomenon of cambial orientation, with an emphasis on a recent computer model that takes the plant hormone auxin as the orienting signal. New model results are presented that demonstrate the surprisingly complex grain patterns that can emerge from simple initial conditions, in qualitative agreement with similar patterns found in wood. Lastly, an alternative theory of wood grain pattern that takes mechanical stress as the orienting signal is critically evaluated.},

abstract = {Plants produce thousands of secondary metabolites (a.k.a. specialized metabolites) of diverse chemical nature. These compounds play important roles in protecting plants under adverse conditions. Many secondary metabolites are valued for their pharmaceutical properties. Because of their beneficial effects to health, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites has been a prime focus of research. Many transcription factors have been characterized for their roles in regulating biosynthetic pathways at the transcriptional level. The emerging picture of transcriptional regulation of secondary metabolite biosynthesis suggests that the expression of activators and repressors, in response to phytohormones and different environmental signals, forms a dynamic regulatory network that fine-tune the timing, amplitude and tissue specific expression of pathway genes and the subsequent accumulation of these compounds. Recent research has revealed that some metabolic pathways are also controlled by posttranscriptional and posttranslational mechanisms. This review will use recent developments in the biosynthesis of flavonoids, alkaloids and terpenoids to highlight the complexity of transcriptional regulation of secondary metabolite biosynthesis.},

abstract = {Tree killing bark beetles and their vectored fungal pathogens are the most destructive agents of conifer forests worldwide. Conifers defend against attack by the constitutive and inducible production of oleoresin, a complex mixture of mono-, sesqui-, and diterpenoids that accumulates at the wound site to kill invaders and both flush and seal the injury. Although toxic to the bark beetle and fungal pathogen, oleoresin also plays a central role in the chemical ecology of these boring insects, from host selection to pheromone signaling and tritrophic level interactions. The biochemistry of oleoresin terpenoids is reviewed, and the regulation of production of this unusual plant secretion is described in the context of bark beetle infestation dynamics with respect to the function of the turpentine and rosin components. Recent advances in the molecular genetics of terpenoid biosynthesis provide evidence for the evolutionary origins of oleoresin and permit consideration of genetic engineering strategies to improve conifer defenses as a component of modern forest biotechnology.},

abstract = {Jatropha (Jatropha curcas) has become one of the most important species for producing biofuels. Currently, Genotype x Environment (GxE) interaction is the biggest challenge that breeders should solve to increase the section accuracy in the plant breeding. Therefore, the objectives in this study were to estimate the parameters in the 180 half-sib families in Jatropha evaluated for five production years, to verify the significance of the GxE interaction variance, to evaluate the adaptability and stability for each family based on three prediction methods, to select superior half-sib families based on the adaptability and stability analyses, and to predict the accuracy for the sixth production year. Jatropha half-sib families were classified and selected using the follow adaptability and stability methods: linear regression, bi-segmented linear regression and mixed models concepts called harmonic mean of the relative performance of genetic values (HMRPGV). The prediction accuracy was estimated by the Pearson correlation between the predicted genetic values by adaptability and stability methods and the phenotypic value in the sixth production year. In result, most half-sib families were classified as general adaptability and general stability for the evaluated traits. The selection gain obtained via HMRPGV was higher than other methods. The prediction accuracy for the sixth production year was 0.45. Therefore, HMRPGV is efficient to maximize the genetic gain, and it can be a useful strategy to select genotype with high adaptability and stability in Jatropha breeding as well as other species that should be evaluated for many years to take a suitable selection accuracy.},

abstract = {Plant secondary metabolites are unique sources for pharmaceuticals, food additives, flavors, and industrially important biochemicals. Accumulation of such metabolites often occurs in plants subjected to stresses including various elicitors or signal molecules. Secondary metabolites play a major role in the adaptation of plants to the environment and in overcoming stress conditions. Environmental factors viz. temperature, humidity, light intensity, the supply of water, minerals, and CO2 influence the growth of a plant and secondary metabolite production. Drought, high salinity, and freezing temperatures are environmental conditions that cause adverse effects on the growth of plants and the productivity of crops. Plant cell culture technologies have been effective tools for both studying and producing plant secondary metabolites under in vitro conditions and for plant improvement. This brief review summarizes the influence of different abiotic factors include salt, drought, light, heavy metals, frost etc. on secondary metabolites in plants. The focus of the present review is the influence of abiotic factors on secondary metabolite production and some of important plant pharmaceuticals. Also, we describe the results of in vitro cultures and production of some important secondary metabolites obtained in our laboratory.},

abstract = {Isoprenoids are functionally and structurally the most diverse group of plant metabolites reported to date. They can function as primary metabolites, participating in essential plant cellular processes, and as secondary metabolites, of which many have substantial commercial, pharmacological, and agricultural value. Isoprenoid end products participate in plants in a wide range of physiological processes acting in them both synergistically, such as chlorophyll and carotenoids during photosynthesis, or antagonistically, such as gibberellic acid and abscisic acid during seed germination. It is therefore expected that fluxes via isoprenoid metabolic network are tightly controlled both temporally and spatially, and that this control occurs at different levels of regulation and in an orchestrated manner over the entire isoprenoid metabolic network. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge of the topology of the plant isoprenoid pathway network and its regulation at the gene expression level following diverse stimuli. We conclude by discussing agronomical and biotechnological applications emerging from the plant isoprenoid metabolism and provide an outlook on future directions in the systems analysis of the plant isoprenoid pathway network.},

abstract = {Late blight (Phytophthora infestans (Mont.) de Bary) and nitrogen (N) significantly affect crop growth of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), but little is known about their interactive effects on radiation interception (RI) and radiation use efficiency (RUE). Two field experiments were conducted in 2006 and 2007 at Braunschweig, Germany, to assess the effects of N supply and late blight infestation on crop growth dynamics of potato in terms of RI, RUE, and dry matter (DM) accumulation. Four nitrogen supply levels (unfertilised up to 160 kg N ha−1 N supply (soil mineral + fertilisation) in 2006, unfertilised – 240 kg N ha−1 in 2007) were tested in combination with two fungicide regimes (sprayed, unsprayed) in two cultivars differing in maturity. N fertilisation increased leaf area index (LAI), leaf area duration (LAD), and RI, and in consequence, tuber yield, but had no significant effect on RUE within a single cultivar. Late blight infection caused premature senescence and defoliation resulting in smaller LAI, shorter LAD, less RI and lower tuber yields. Late blight had no effect on RUE if leaf area was corrected for disease severity. Significant interactions between N level, fungicide treatment and cultivar on late blight disease spread were found affecting LAI and RI. This study shows that total DM accumulation of potatoes can be predicted by RI and RUE, even if N supply is limited and late blight control incomplete as long as the late blight effect on RI can be properly estimated.},

Specifically, we investigated growth, chlorophyll content, lipid peroxidation (LPO), activities of antioxidant enzymes and H2O2 accumulation. The results showed that PHE inhibited seed germination, affected the growth and chlorophyll level of wheat seedlings. Furthermore, PHE elevated the levels of LPO and induced H2O2 accumulation in leaf tissues in a dose-dependent manner, accompanied by the changes in the antioxidant status. The activities of antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX), displayed a decreasing trend with the increasing of PHE concentration. The results indicated that PHE could exert oxidative damages in the early development stage of wheat and the harmfulness occurred mainly in samples with higher concentrations of PHE.},

A graphical review of variances, etc., reported in the literature for thirty-nine other blank experiments indicates that the results of most such experiments conform to the same law. It is shown that the above law can be generalized (so as to be applicable to any size of field) by applying a certain adjustment to the regression coefficient b', so as to give a modified coefficient b applicable to an “infinite” field. From this generalized relationship there has been deduced an expression ((4), p. 16) to indicate average relative efficiencies to be expected for randomized block experiments with varying numbers of plots per block in a field for which the coefficient b is known. A formulae (5), which may be used to estimate the most efficient size of plot for any given experiment, has also been deduced. The cost of using plots of other than the most efficient size is indicated graphically in Fig. 7.},

abstract = {Reliability of estimated breeding values (EBV) depends on amount of information in both phenotypic data and pedigree data. This study investigated the impact of phenotypic information of previous generations and depth of pedigree on estimates of genetic parameters and breeding values in populations of polytocous animals such as pig. Three populations which mimicked pig populations were generated. The animals were selected on a selection index including two traits (h2=0.35 for trait 1 and h2=0.10 for trait 2). Variance components and breeding values were estimated using different phenotypic data and pedigree data which cover different numbers of previous generations. Impact of phenotypic information of previous generations and depth of pedigree on EBV was evaluated by reliability of EBV for animals in the last generation (as candidates for breeding). Phenotypic data or pedigree data covering various numbers of previous generations led to different estimates of additive genetic variance (larger variance when earlier generations were included), especially for trait 1, because conceptual base populations were different in different data sets. Information from previous generations was more important for reliability of EBV of trait 2 than that of trait 1, and the contribution of previous phenotypic information to reliability of EBV was larger in the population with smallest sib group than the population with the largest sib group. According to the current study, phenotypic data including recent three to five generations and pedigree data added one to three ancestral generations will lead to asymptotic maximum reliability of EBV for animals in current population, dependent on population structure and heritability of trait. The results indicate: (1) In general, three generations of records plus two ancestral generations in pedigree is enough for predicting breeding values with regard to accuracy of EBV; (2) Variance components used for genetic evaluation should be estimated from the data set that is consistent with the data set for predicting breeding values with regard to conceptual base population; (3) In order to increase reliability of EBV in a polytocous animal population such as pig, the efficient approach is to measure the animals available within generation as many as possible so as to fully use information from sibs, instead of more data from early generations.},

abstract = {The present study aimed to correlate the performance of rubber tree [Hevea brasiliensis (Willd. ex. Adr. de Juss.) Muell-Arg] ortets selected in progenies tests and the performance of their respective ramets in the clonal test. In the progenies tests three early measurements were carried out for the traits early rubber yield (ERP), number of vassel latex rings (NVR) and bark thickness (BKT). Using the HMMm (Hamaker Morris-Mann modified) test the best ortets were selected based on rubber yield and cloned to set the clonal test. In the clonal test the same traits were studied, but the dry rubber production (DRP) was assessed in the normal tapping (from the seventh year of age). Statistical analyses were carried out using the REML/BLUP (restricted maximum likelihood/best linear unbiased prediction) method. After studying the progenies and clonal tests, the correlation between the performance of ortets and ramets was estimated and the performance of the ortets in the second and third early tests (ERP2 and ERP3) has proven to be reliable, since the observed estimate of the correlation coefficient with its ramets was significant. The study showed that if taken into account the second and/or third early test, there is reliability that the most productive ortets selected in nursery stage will originate more productive clones. It is efficient to select rubber tree based on the early rubber production, thus reducing the long rubber tree breeding cycle.},

abstract = {Studies on chromosome doubling of wheat pollen plants have been conducted, and a simple and efficient procedure for increasing the chromosome doubling frequency of wheat pollen plants was developed. Culture of the pollen calli on a colchicine-containing medium before transferring them to the regeneration medium increased the chromosome doubling frequency of the plants derived from these calli. The suitable concentration of the colchicine in the medium was around 250 mg/l, and the optimum duration for the calli to stay on the colchicine-containing medium was 1 day. Under these conditions, the chromosome doubling frequency of the pollen plants was greatly increased, but the ability of the calli to differentiate green shoots was generally not affected. The ability of the calli to differentiate green shoots was lowered mainly by a long duration of colchicine treatment. When the pollen calli were transferred to the regeneration medium in two or three batches, the pollen plants derived from the second batch of calli showed significantly higher spontaneous chromosome doubling frequency than the plants derived from the first batch of calli.},

Convenient methods for computing BLUE of the estimable linear functions of the fixed elements of the model and for computing best linear unbiased predictions of the random elements of the model have been available. Most data available to animal breeders, however, do not meet the usual requirements of random sampling, the problem being that the data arise either from selection experiments or from breeders' herds which are undergoing selection. Consequently, the usual methods are likely to yield biased estimates and predictions. Methods for dealing with such data are presented in this paper.},

The tests were conducted in Tenente Portela-RS and Braga-RS. The experimental design was randomized blocks arranged in factorial scheme, 2 locations × 17 genotypes and 3 repetitions. The evaluated characters were plant height, main stem spike mass, tiller spikes mass, main stem spike grains number, tiller spikes grains number, main stem spike grains mass, tiller spikes grains mass, mass of a thousand grains and grain yield. Path analysis was performed for characters associated with grain yield. The results show that main stem spike grains mass, main stem spike grains number, and tiller spikes grains mass have direct effects on grain yield. Larger main stem spike grains mass, main stem spike grains number, and tiller spikes grains mass should be considered for achieving genotypes of high grain yield potential.},

@article{ladizinsky_synthetic_2000-1,
abstract = {A synthetic hexaploid oat was produced by chromosome doubling of a sterile triploid hybrid between cultivated Avena strigosa (2n = 14) cv. Saia and a domesticated form of A. magna (2n = 28). The synthetic hexaploid was intermediate between its parents in panicle shape and lemma color, similar to the tetraploid parent in spikelet structure, and to the diploid parent in having a single, albeit partially shriveled seed per spikelet, and low protein content. By the third generation, plants with yellowish lemmas, mostly two seeds per spikelet and better filled grains had been selected. Rust resistance of the diploid parent was retained in the synthetic hexaploid, but not tolerance to barley yellow dwarf virus disease (BYDV). Chromosome associations at meiosis in the triploid hybrid was low, with over 60{\%} of them being univalents. Bivalent association was the rule in the synthetic hexaploid with an occasional one or two quadrivalents. Regular meiosis with 21 bivalents was observed in further generations. The preferential pairing of homologous chromosomes in the synthetic hexaploid was probably contributed by the A. strigosa genome which exhibits this tendency in artificial allopolyploid situations. Selection of yellow lemma color and two seeds per spikelet suggests that the genes controlling these traits are located on the chromosomes involved in quadrivalents in the synthetic hexaploid. The potential and limitations of utilizing the synthetic hexaploid in oat research and breeding are briefly discussed.},

@article{jackson_root_1990-1,
abstract = {Tomato root growth and distribution were related to inorganic nitrogen (N) availability and turnover to determine 1) if roots were located in soil zones where N supply was highest, and 2) whether roots effectively depleted soil N so that losses of inorganic N were minimized. Tomatoes were direct-seeded in an unfertilized field in Central California. A trench profile/monolith sampling method was used. Concentrations of nitrate (NO3 -) exceeded those of ammonium (NH4 +) several fold, and differences were greater at the soil surface (0–15 cm) than at lower depths (45–60 cm or 90–120 cm). Ammonium and NO3 - levels peaked in April before planting, as did mineralizable N and nitrification potential. Soon afterwards, NO3 - concentrations decreased, especially in the lower part of the profile, most likely as a result of leaching after application of irrigation water. Nitrogen pool sizes and rates of microbial processes declined gradually through the summer. Tomato plants utilized only a small percentage of the inorganic N available in the large volume of soil explored by their deep root systems; maximum daily uptake was approximately 3{\%} of the soil pool. Root distribution, except for the zone around the taproot, was uniformly sparse (ca. 0.15 mg dry wt g-1 soil or 0.5 cm g-1 soil) throughout the soil profile regardless of depth, distance from the plant stem, or distance from the irrigation furrow. It bore no relation to N availability. Poor root development, especially in the N-rich top layer of soil, could explain low fertilizer N use by tomatoes.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate whether ground reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea) straw (RC) could be used to replace peat for short production cycle greenhouse crops. Characteristics of RC, peat, mixture of RC + peat (50{\%} + 50{\%}), and coir were determined and the performance of strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa cv. Elsanta) on these substrates was evaluated. Water holding capacity of RC was low in comparison to peat and coir, but could probably be improved by decreasing its particle size in processing. The buffering capacity of RC was similar to coir, but clearly lower than in peat. Because of similar reactions to addition of base, liming recommendation of RC would probably be approximately the same as for peat. The C-to-N ratio was 60 in coir, 41 in peat, 23 in RC, and 29 in the mixture of RC + peat. High concentration of inorganic N in RC was rapidly consumed by the microbial activity in the incubation experiment. Vegetative growth of the strawberry plants was the most vigorous in peat, but the total yield, berry size, and sugar to acid ratio in berries were similar in all the substrates. In conclusion, ground reed canary grass may be used to replace peat or coir in soilless culture of strawberry. However, due to its low water holding capacity, irrigation regime has to be adjusted accordingly.},

abstract = {Woody plants contain lignin that serves as a key structural polymer that adds rigidity and strength to the plant cell wall. Lignification occurs after the secondary cell wall polysaccharide network is deposited, limiting access to the cell wall from wood-destroying organisms as well as changing the hydrophilicity of the cell wall. While lignin is referred to in general terms, there are three types of monomers involved in lignification, and this ratio is dependent across lignocellulose biomass types such as grasses, angiosperms, and gymnosperms. Furthermore, isolated lignin is a heterogeneous polymer with its physical and mechanical properties highly dependent on biomass source, location within the cell wall, delignification methods, and purification schemes. Fortunately, the dominant lignin source available is commercial lignins formed as a by-product of the pulp and paper industry and generally classified as hardwood and softwood lignins. Despite the production of large quantities of lignin during delignification, the majority of lignin is burned for energy generation. Examples of commercialized added value materials from lignin are limited, and unlocking new lignin conversion strategies holds enormous potential to enable a green economy for sustainable consumption.},

abstract = {Sperm quality has an important role in determining fertility. The aims of this study were to compare the conventional sperm parameters, plus the characteristics of the motility patterns of the different sperm subpopulations, of donkey donors with different fertility level, and to determine their relationships to fertility. Thirty ejaculates from 6 Andalusian donkeys were assessed for gel-free volume, pH, sperm concentration, motility and morphology. The fertility of donkeys was classified on the basis of pregnancy rates per cycle, where donkeys with a per cycle pregnancy rate ≥60{\%} were considered to be “fertile” (n = 3) and those with a per cycle pregnancy rate {\textless}40{\%} were categorized to be “sub-fertile” (n = 3). Significant differences (P {\textless} 0.001) between the “fertile” and the “sub-fertile” group were found for total and progressive motility, and for straight line velocity. Sperm variables associated (P {\textless} 0.05) with an increase in percent pregnant per cycle included total motility (r = 0.37), progressive motility (r = 0.53), curvilinear velocity (r = 0.44), straightness (r = 0.39), beat cross frequency (r = 0.44), and gel-free volume (r = 0.53). Four sperm subpopulations (sP) were identified in fresh semen: sP1 (slow and non-progressive spermatozoa, 20{\%}), sP2 (moderately slow but progressive spermatozoa, 71.2{\%}), sP3 (highly active but non-progressive spermatozoa, 2.9{\%}), and sP4 (highly active and progressive spermatozoa, 5.9{\%}). The lowest percentage (3.1{\%}; P {\textless} 0.001) of sP4 spermatozoa was observed in the “sub-fertile” group. Three of the sperm subpopulations were related (P {\textless} 0.05) to fertility (sP2, r = 0.54; sP3, r = 0.45; sP4, r = 0.56). In conclusion, we were able to relate the fertility of donkeys with in vitro measures of sperm motility using computer-assisted sperm analysis techniques.},

abstract = {The transgenic line B73-6-1 (developed and characterized by UK scientists) contains 10–15 extra copies of a native HMW glutenin gene (1Dx5) with an approximately four-fold increase in the amount of the encoded protein. The technological and rheological properties of this line and the non-transformed control line were studied in a continental type, arid climatic environment (Martonv{\'{a}}s{\'{a}}r, Hungary, 2000–2002). The results show that in the three years of the field experiment, the transgene and associated functional properties were stably inherited over several generations. No difference was found in yield between the transgenic line and the original genotype, but clear genotypic differences were found in kernel hardness and kernel size. The transgenic line had an increased kernel hardness and a smaller kernel size. The transgenic line B73-6-1 tended to have a higher protein content than the control L88-6, but this difference was not statistically significant. In contrast there was a significant, 400{\%}, increase in the amount of 1Dx5 HMW glutenin subunits, Dx/Dy-, HMW/LMW- and glutenin/gliadin ratio. At the same time there was a decrease in wet gluten content and SDS sedimentation. Thus, significant changes in the structure of the protein matrix caused by the altered x to y ratio of HMW-GS and as a result of this alteration, flour functional properties changed. Parameters that characterize the stability and strength of the dough confirmed that B73-6-1 was stronger, but the extensibility was reduced. This flour would be suitable for blending with flour of lower grade.},

All accessions were characterized for 67 agro-morphological traits from seedling emergence to crop maturity. Morphological data were subjected to principal components analysis followed by hierarchical agglomerative clustering. This provided seven groups based on morphological and agronomic properties. The first six principal components axes accounted for 54.29{\%} of the variance among the 48 accessions and their lines. The greater part of variance was accounted for by traits such as fruit diameter, fruit weight, volume, fruit wall thickness, fruit productivity, and fruit soluble solid and dry matter content. The high diversity found in the collection showed its great potential for improving agronomic traits in pepper.},

abstract = {Recent developments of multivariate smoothing methods provide a rich collection of feasible models for nonparametric multivariate data analysis. Among the most interpretable are those with smoothed additive terms. Construction of various methods and algorithms for computing the models have been the main concern in literature in this area. Less results are available on the validation of computed fit, instead, and many applications of nonparametric methods end up in computing and comparing the generalized validation error or related indexes. This article reviews the behaviour of some of the best known multivariate nonparametric methods, based on subset selection and on projection, when (exact) collinearity or multicollinearity (near collinearity) is present in the input matrix. It shows the possible aliasing effects in computed fits of some selection methods and explores the properties of the projection spaces reached by projection methods in order to help data analysts to select the best model in case of ill conditioned input matrices. Two simulation studies and a real data set application are presented to illustrate further the effects of collinearity or multicollinearity in the fit.},

Sink intensity then became very low for the first 3 days following anthesis after which it recovered in normally setting flowers, but failed to recover in normally abscising flowers. It is concluded that soybean reproductive abscission is determined at or very near the day of anthesis.},

The purpose of this research is to describe the application of causal path analysis to grain yield in maize (Zea mays L.) to take into account the sequential development of yield components. Causal-admissible path analysis was performed assuming unidirectional causal relationships among yield components of eight maize populations. Sequential path analysis of the five yield components studied revealed that ears per plant had the highest direct effect on grain yield. However, the indirect effects of component traits via number of grains per ear was maximum. It was concluded that the number of kernels per ear, prolificacy, and grain size serve as potential characters in breeding for superior lines for grain yield in maize.},

Nine top cross hybrids obtained in the 2012/2013 harvest were evaluated along with their testator, the landraces used as parents, and four commercial hybrids, in a randomized block design, with information taken from the average of each plot. The evaluated traits were: leaf angle, number of ramifications of the tassel, spike insertion height, plant height, spike diameter, number of grains per spike, mass of grains per spike, spike mass, spike length, prolificity, mass of one hundred grains, and grain yield per plot. The data were analyzed using the Selegen-REML/BLUP software.

Nonnormal data such as counts or proportions often defy classical statistical procedures. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) provide a more flexible approach for analyzing nonnormal data when random effects are present. The explosion of research on GLMMs in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult. We review the use (and misuse) of GLMMs in ecology and evolution, discuss estimation and inference and summarize ‘best-practice' data analysis procedures for scientists facing this challenge.},

@article{kruger_metabolic_2008-1,
abstract = {Predictive models of plant metabolism with sufficient power to identify suitable targets for metabolic engineering are desirable, but elusive. The problem is particularly acute in the pathways of primary carbon metabolism, and ultimately it stems from the complexity of the plant metabolic network and the plethora of interacting components that determine the observed fluxes. This complexity is manifested most obviously in the remarkable biosynthetic capacity of plant metabolism, and in the extensive subcellular compartmentation of steps and pathways. However it is argued that while these properties provide a considerable challenge at the level of identifying enzymes and metabolic interconversions ‐ indeed the definition of the plant metabolic network is still incomplete ‐ the real obstacle to predictive modelling lies in identifying the complete set of regulatory mechanisms that influence the function of the network. These mechanisms operate at two levels: one is the molecular crosstalk between effectors and enzymes; and the other is gene expression, where the relationship between fluctuations in expression and network performance is still poorly understood. The tools that are currently available for analysing network structure and performance are described, with particular emphasis on constraints‐based network analysis, metabolic flux analysis, kinetic modelling and metabolic control analysis. Based on a varying mix of theoretical analysis and empirical measurement, all four methods provide insights into the organisation of metabolic networks and the fluxes they support. Specifically they can be used to analyse the robustness of metabolic networks, to generate flux maps that reveal the relationship between genotype and metabolic phenotype, to predict metabolic fluxes in well characterised systems, and to analyse the relationship between substrates, enzymes and fluxes. No single method provides all the information necessary for predictive metabolic engineering, although in principle kinetic modelling should achieve that goal if sufficient information is available to parameterize the models completely. The level of sophistication that is required in predictive models of primary carbon metabolism is illustrated by analysing the conclusions that have emerged from extensive metabolic studies of transgenic plants with reduced levels of Calvin cycle enzymes. These studies highlight the intricate mechanisms that underpin the responsiveness and stability of carbon fixation. It is argued that while the phenotypes of the transgenic plants can be rationalised in terms of a qualitative understanding of the components of the system, it is not yet possible to predict the behaviour of the network quantitatively because of the complexity of the interactions involved.},

abstract = {Inhibiting proteasome functional insufficiency plays an essential role in cancer prevention. Alternative strategies to target ubiquitin enzymes and ubiquitin-signal autophagic degradation can be the potential treatments. Phenolic compounds demonstrated anti-cancer effects. Phenolic compounds not only effectively inhibit E1, deubiquitinating enzyme, and 26S activity but also induce apoptosis in A549 cells. The IC50 of 26S activity and LD50 of A549 cells were nearly equivalent. Therefore, apoptosis may occur via the inhibition of the 26S proteasome activity. Inhibition of the proteasome by tannic acid in A549 cells resulted in reduction of S5a and 20S, accumulation of ubiquitin, and degradation of PARP, followed by induction of apoptosis. USP15 may play an essential role in the stability and activity of caspase-3. The levels of S5a, USP15 and USP47 were regulated by phenolic compounds, and the levels of procaspase-3 and polyADP-ribose polymerase were also decreased in A549 cells treated with phenolic compounds. Interestingly, tannic acid decreased Ub-conjugates while M + G + E increased the accumulation of Ub-conjugates in A549 reporter cells, whereas ubiquitin, E1, and USP47 levels were low in M + G + E-treated A549 reporter cells at 24 hours. Taken together, phenolic compounds may play an important role in mediating apoptosis by regulating the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway and autophagy system.},

abstract = {Combined effects of temperature, ultraviolet-B radiation and exogenous plant hormones on plant growth and development have received little attention. The objectives of this study were to determine morphological and physiological responses of pea (Pisum sativum L. cv. 237, Mr. Big) to two temperature regimes (24/20 °C and 28/24 °C; 16 h day/8 h night), two UVB levels (0 and 5 kJ m−2 d−1), and two salicylic acid treatments (0 or 100 $\mu$l of 1 mM solution every other day). We germinated pea seeds under 24/20 °C, kept the seedlings under this condition for one week and then grew them under experimental conditions for three weeks. The measured parameters included growth and development, dry mass accumulation, gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, chlorophyll content, epicuticular wax, and flavonoids. Higher temperatures reduced growth and biomass accumulation, and increased transpiration and stomatal conductance, leading to an overall decrease in water use efficiency (WUE). Regardless of UVB levels or salicylic acid application, higher temperatures decreased maximum quantum yield of PSII and non-photochemical quenching, but increased photochemical quenching and chlorophyll content. UVB radiation decreased overall growth and biomass accumulation as well as net CO2 assimilation and WUE. Irrespective of temperature, UVB increased protective compounds (epicuticular wax and flavonoids), but decreased chlorophyll content. At both temperatures and UVB levels, exogenous salicylic acid significantly increased all aspects of plant growth and biomass accumulation. Also, salicylic acid significantly increased net CO2 assimilation and marginally increased chlorophyll content, but had no effect on chlorophyll fluorescence or protective compounds. Several significant relationships were found between the above-mentioned parameters. Effects of temperature and UVB radiation were additive for stem height, leaf area, and growth rate. Plants grown under UVB5 with salicylic acid application had the most leaves, whereas plants grown under UVB5 without salicylic acid had the least. Similarly, plants grown under UVB0 with salicylic acid application had the largest leaves, whereas plants grown under UVB5 without salicylic acid had the smallest ones. This study revealed that higher temperatures and UVB radiation exert an adverse effect on pea plants, and some of the detrimental effects of these stress factors can be mitigated by exogenous salicylic acid.},

abstract = {A 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase (EC 1.14.11.11) which catalyzes the 4-hydroxylation of desacetoxyvindoline was purified to homogeneity. Three oligopeptides isolated from a tryptic digest of the purified protein were microsequenced and one oligopeptide showed significant homology to hyoscyamine 6$\beta$-hydroxylase from Hyoscyamus niger. A 36-mer degenerate oligonucleotide based on this peptide sequence was used to screen a Catharanthus roseus cDNA library and three clones, cD4H-1 to -3, were isolated. Although none of the three clones were full-length, the open reading frame on each clone encoded a putative protein containing the sequence of all three peptides. Primer extension analysis suggested that cD4H-3, the longest cDNA clone, was missing 156 bp at the 5′ end of the clone and sequencing of the genomic clone, gD4H-8, confirmed these results. Southern blot analysis suggested that d4h is present as a single-copy gene in C. roseus which is a diploid plant, and the significant differences in the sequence of the 3′-UTR between cD4H-1 and -3 suggest that they represent dimorphic alleles of the same hydroxylase. The identity of the clone was further confirmed when extracts of transformed Escherichia coli expressed D4H enzyme activity. The D4H clone encoded a putative protein of 401 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 45.5 kDa and the amino acid sequence showed a high degree of similarity with those of a growing family of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases of plant and fungal origin. The similarity was not restricted to the dioxygenase protein sequences but was also extended to the gene structure and organization since the 205 and 1720 bp introns of d4h were inserted around the same highly conserved amino acid consensus sequences as those for e8 protein, hyoscyamine-6$\beta$-hydroxylase and ethylene-forming enzyme. These results provide further support that a common ancestral gene is responsible for the appearance of this family of dioxygenases. Hydroxylase assays and RNA blot hybridization studies showed that enzyme activity followed closely the levels of d4h transcripts, occurring predominantly in young leaves and in much lower levels in stems and fruits. In contrast, etiolated seedlings which contained considerable levels of d4h transcripts had almost undetectable hydroxylase activity, whereas exposure of seedlings to light resulted in a rapid increase of enzyme activity without a significant further increase in d4h transcripts over those detected in dark-grown seedlings. These results suggest that the activating effect of light may occur at a point downstream of transcription which remains to be elucidated.},

@article{mehrabadi_inhibitory_2012-2,
abstract = {In many countries, the Sunn pest, Eurygaster integriceps Puton (Hemiptera: Scutelleridae) is one of the most important insect pests of wheat. Chemical control of E. integriceps is not efficient making it essential to find other control methods. Plant $\alpha$-amylase inhibitors expressed as transgenes have emerged as a promising way of controlling insect pests and several crop species expressing transgenic amylase inhibitors have been shown to be resistant to certain insect pest. Here we report inhibition of salivary $\alpha$-amylases of E. integriceps by semi-purified proteinaceous $\alpha$-amylase inhibitors from Triticale (TAI). A dose dependent trend of inhibition of the enzyme was observed using TAI with an I50 value of 0.79 $\mu$g of TAI. At the highest concentration of the inhibitor used here, we found 87{\%} inhibition of amylase activity. The inhibitory activity was maximal at pH at 5.0, which is in accordance with the pH optimum of the salivary gland enzymes. Kinetic studies of enzyme-inhibitor interaction revealed a kind of partial mixed inhibition with an apparent inhibitory constant value (Ki[app]) of 1.1 $\mu$g of TAI against salivary $\alpha$-amylase in the assay medium. In gel inhibition assays showed that all isoforms of salivary glands $\alpha$-amylase were sensitive to the TAI, although to different degrees. Moreover, the effectiveness of TAI was retained in different stages of pre-oral and oral digestion of E. integriceps, although some inhibitory activity was lost, possibly by the action of the insect proteases. These findings indicate that TAI shows promise for use in the management of this pest. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of inhibitor-insect digestive enzymes interaction, based on the insect feeding strategy and digestion process.},

@article{dormann_collinearity:_2013,
abstract = {Collinearity refers to the non independence of predictor variables, usually in a regression-type analysis. It is a common feature of any descriptive ecological data set and can be a problem for parameter estimation because it inflates the variance of regression parameters and hence potentially leads to the wrong identification of relevant predictors in a statistical model. Collinearity is a severe problem when a model is trained on data from one region or time, and predicted to another with a different or unknown structure of collinearity. To demonstrate the reach of the problem of collinearity in ecology, we show how relationships among predictors differ between biomes, change over spatial scales and through time. Across disciplines, different approaches to addressing collinearity problems have been developed, ranging from clustering of predictors, threshold-based pre-selection, through latent variable methods, to shrinkage and regularisation. Using simulated data with five predictor-response relationships of increasing complexity and eight levels of collinearity we compared ways to address collinearity with standard multiple regression and machine-learning approaches. We assessed the performance of each approach by testing its impact on prediction to new data. In the extreme, we tested whether the methods were able to identify the true underlying relationship in a training dataset with strong collinearity by evaluating its performance on a test dataset without any collinearity. We found that methods specifically designed for collinearity, such as latent variable methods and tree based models, did not outperform the traditional GLM and threshold-based pre-selection. Our results highlight the value of GLM in combination with penalised methods (particularly ridge) and threshold-based pre-selection when omitted variables are considered in the final interpretation. However, all approaches tested yielded degraded predictions under change in collinearity structure and the ‘folk lore'-thresholds of correlation coefficients between predictor variables of {\{}$\backslash$textbar{\}}r{\{}$\backslash$textbar{\}} {\{}{\textgreater}{\}}0.7 was an appropriate indicator for when collinearity begins to severely distort model estimation and subsequent prediction. The use of ecological understanding of the system in pre-analysis variable selection and the choice of the least sensitive statistical approaches reduce the problems of collinearity, but cannot ultimately solve them.},

For this task this study compared two different statistical procedures, i.e., the separate analysis of variance (ANOVA), being applied usually in the practical analysis of the multilocation trials with random locations, and the best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) based on a variance component mixed model, by simultaneous analysis of various cultivar multilocation trails of rape in case of random locations. The phenotypic correlation of genotype effect prediction between trial locations and the average variance of differences between the genotype predictions were used, respectively for assessing the precision and the efficiency of the analysis procedures in evaluating the location-specific genotype effects. The result showed that the use of the separate ANOVA and the BLUP could result in some difference in prediction, ranking and statistical testing of location-specific genotype effects. Compared to the separate ANOVA, the BLUP based a variance component mixed model provided both a high precision and a high efficiency in prediction of the location-specific genotype effects for the rape trials with random locations.},

In a previous paper (Kressner et al., 2009 [13]), the authors compared the structured and unstructured condition numbers of (possibly multiple) eigenvalues for several different matrix and pencil structures. Only one case was left out of the analysis, namely the one where the asymptotic order of perturbed eigenvalues under structured perturbations is different from the asymptotic order under unstructured ones. This is precisely the case we consider in the present paper: given a matrix which is skew-adjoint with respect to a symmetric scalar product and has a zero eigenvalue with a certain Jordan structure, first order expansions are obtained for the perturbed eigenvalues under structured perturbation, as well as bounds on the structured condition number. Similar results are obtained for structured perturbations of symmetric/skew-symmetric and palindromic matrix pencils.},

abstract = {Recent advances in the cell, developmental, and molecular biology of alkaloid biosynthesis have heightened our appreciation for the complexity and importance of plant secondary pathways. Several biosynthetic genes involved in the formation of tropane, benzylisoquinoline, and terpenoid indole alkaloids have now been isolated. The early events of signal perception, the pathways of signal transduction, and the function of gene promoters have been studied in relation to the regulation of alkaloid metabolism. Enzymes involved in alkaloid biosynthesis are associated with diverse subcellular compartments including the cytosol, vacuole, tonoplast membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, chloroplast stroma, thylakoid membranes, and perhaps unique “biosynthetic” or transport vesicles. Localization studies have shown that sequential alkaloid biosynthetic enzymes can also occur in distinct cell types, suggesting the intercellular transport of pathway intermediates. Isolated genes have also been used to genetically alter the accumulation of specific alkaloids and other plant secondary metabolites. Metabolic modifications include increased indole alkaloid levels, altered tropane alkaloid accumulation, elevated serotonin synthesis, reduced indole glucosinolate production, redirected shikimate metabolism, and increased cell wall–bound tyramine formation. This review discusses the biochemistry, cell biology, molecular regulation, and metabolic engineering of alkaloid biosynthesis in plants.},

@article{ceccarelli_breeding_1991,
abstract = {Summary Attempts to identify individual traits to use as an indirect measure for grain yield have shown some degree of success in environments where crop yields are affected by no stress or only by predictable stresses. However, analytical breeding has been largely unsuccessful in the case of a) stressful environments characterized by low yields due to high variability in the frequency, timing, duration and severity of a number of climatic stresses, and b) breeding programs where the major objective is greater yield stability defined as a reduction in the frequency of crop failures. Experimental evidence suggests that, when environmental variability is high due to unpredictable differences in frequency, timing and severity of various climatic stresses, each time different combinations of several traits are likely to confer ‘drought resistance'. Interaction among traits in determining overall crop response to variable stresses is expected to occasionally enhance the importance of a specific trait in a specific stress situation. In this context it becomes difficult to consider ‘drought resistance' as a character with its own identity in terms of inheritance. Assessment and verification of traits based on the use of isogenic lines tends to oversimplify the interactions between traits, as the approach provides information on the effect of a specific trait only in a specific genetic background. At the population level of organisation, the dilemma between selection for individual traits and specific combinations of traits can be translated into the dilemma between selection for individual genotypes and specific combinations of genotypes. The evidence that natural selection under stress conditions has not been able to identify either a single trait or a single genotype with a given ‘adapted' architecture of traits, is discussed in relation to germplasm development philosophies to stabilize yield in unpredictably stressed environments.},

In this review we discuss recent progress in understanding SL action in planta, particularly in the context of the regulation of shoot branching, one of the best-characterized endogenous roles for SLs. Rapid progress has been made in understanding SL biosynthesis, but many questions remain unanswered. There are hints of as yet unidentified sources of SL, as well as unknown SL–like molecules with important signalling functions. SL signalling is even more enigmatic. Although a likely receptor has been identified, along with some candidate immediate downstream targets, our understanding of how these targets mediate SL signalling is limited. There is still considerable uncertainty about whether the targets of SL signalling are primarily transcriptional or not. There is at least one non-transcriptional target, because a rapid primary response to SL is the removal of PIN1 auxin exporter proteins from the plasma membrane in vascular-associated cells of the stem. We discuss how the various early events in SL signalling could result in the observed changes in shoot branching.},

abstract = {Jasmonates (JAs) mediate plant responses to insect attack, wounding, pathogen infection, stress, and UV damage and regulate plant fertility, anthocyanin accumulation, trichome formation, and many other plant developmental processes. Arabidopsis thaliana Jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins, substrates of the CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1)–based SCFCOI1 complex, negatively regulate these plant responses. Little is known about the molecular mechanism for JA regulation of anthocyanin accumulation and trichome initiation. In this study, we revealed that JAZ proteins interact with bHLH (Transparent Testa8, Glabra3 [GL3], and Enhancer of Glabra3 [EGL3]) and R2R3 MYB transcription factors (MYB75 and Glabra1), essential components of WD-repeat/bHLH/MYB transcriptional complexes, to repress JA-regulated anthocyanin accumulation and trichome initiation. Genetic and physiological evidence showed that JA regulates WD-repeat/bHLH/MYB complex-mediated anthocyanin accumulation and trichome initiation in a COI1-dependent manner. Overexpression of the MYB transcription factor MYB75 and bHLH factors (GL3 and EGL3) restored anthocyanin accumulation and trichome initiation in the coi1 mutant, respectively. We speculate that the JA-induced degradation of JAZ proteins abolishes the interactions of JAZ proteins with bHLH and MYB factors, allowing the transcriptional function of WD-repeat/bHLH/MYB complexes, which subsequently activate respective downstream signal cascades to modulate anthocyanin accumulation and trichome initiation.},

The objective of the present work was to evaluate the implications of sampling size over the results obtained with the application of tests F and Tukey in the analysis of sorghum traits variance. Another objective was to identify ideal sample sizes for those traits, by using two methods: use of the experimental coefficient of variation value (CV) alone; use of formula involving the variance of an estimated plot mean based on a sampling units. Eight sorghum cultivars were evaluated in a random block design with four replicates. All plants in the plot (45), in addition to eight sample sizes (varying from 5 to 40 units, at 5-unit intervals) were utilized to evaluate plant height (PH), dry matter in the vegetative above-ground part of the plant (without the panicle) (DMP), length (PL), and panicle dry matter (PDM). It was observed that the F and Tukey tests, based on samples, could result in different conclusions from those obtained when all plants in the plot are utilized to evaluate DMP and PDM. About 25 units represent samples for the estimation of the four characteristics, when the CV value is used. The adoption of the sample size formula proved that to estimate PH, DMP, PL, and PDM, the ideal sample sizes would be 14 plants, 11 plants, 14 panicles, and 24 panicles, respectively.},

There was a distinct difference in panicle weight among tillers during grain filling for both genotypes, with Xiushui 11 having a greater increase rate in panicle weight, and being earlier in reaching the maximum panicle weight than the mutant. There was a great significant difference between the two genotypes in grain yield and its components, with Xiushui 11 having higher grain yield, more grains per panicle, higher filled grain percentage and grain weight than the mutant for each type of tiller. Moreover, a significant difference was found in grain yield and yield components among different tillers for both genotypes, with grain number per panicle showing the greatest variation over tillers among all yield components. Compared with Xiushui 11, the mutant had higher brown rice rate and greater ratio of length to width of brown rice, and lower chalky rice rate, amylose content, and protein content of rice. Furthermore, there was a significant difference in grain quality among tillers within a plant for both genotypes, with later initiated tillers being lower in chalky rice rate, amylose and protein contents than early initiated ones. The variation of most quality parameters among tillers within a plant was markedly larger for the mutant than for Xiushui 11.},

Pvclust can be used easily for general statistical problems, such as DNA microarray analysis, to perform the bootstrap analysis of clustering, which has been popular in phylogenetic analysis. Pvclust calculates probability values (p-values) for each cluster using bootstrap resampling techniques. Two types of p-values are available: approximately unbiased (AU) p-value and bootstrap probability (BP) value. Multiscale bootstrap resampling is used for the calculation of AU p-value, which has superiority in bias over BP value calculated by the ordinary bootstrap resampling. In addition the computation time can be enormously decreased with parallel computing option.},

Physiological effects that the same pigments exert in plants are supposedly similar to those which they show in humans following ingestion of coloured food.

abstract = {The rise of the atmospheric CO2 concentration ([CO2]) improves wheat growth and yield but affects grain protein concentration (GP{\%}) by decreasing gluten concentration and thus baking quality. The reasons for the negative CO2-effect on grain quality are still under debate. It is discussed that the decrease of GP{\%} under elevated [CO2] results from growth dilution and /or a reduction of N acquisition. The objectives of this project are to investigate the N-acquisition and remobilization to the grain to understand the processes involved in the decrease of GP{\%} under FACE.

We have started a two-year (2014-2015) FACE-experiment (400 ppm/600 ppm) with winter wheat grown at three N levels (ca. 60/200/340 kg ha-1) and under well watered conditions.

During the growing period in 2014 destructive plant sampling was done once a month until grain maturity and crop growth and N{\%} of different plant fractions were measured.

Seasonal course of LAI strongly depended on N supply and was hardly influenced by CO2 enrichment. [CO2] elevation increased leaf and stem biomass by ca. 5 – 14 {\%}, but the CO2 effect did not increase with N supply as expected. N{\%} in green leaves was slightly more decreased by [CO2] elevation than N{\%} in stems. Total amount of N in the shoot at anthesis strongly increased with N supply and CO2 enrichment had a smaller effect (+4{\%}) at the highest N level than at 60 and 200 kg N ha-1 (+10{\%}).

In addition, data from the first test year on N remobilization and on GP{\%} will be presented.},

abstract = {The isolation of morphine (‘principium somniferum') by Friedrich Wilhelm Sert{\"{u}}rner about 200 years ago is generally accepted as the beginning of scientific phytochemistry (plant secondary products research). For about 150 years this research addressed almost exclusively the isolation and structure elucidation of new plant products. It had great impact on the development of modern organic chemistry and pharmaceutical industry and provided the chemical basis for biological research on plant secondary metabolism, which began about 50 years ago. The historical development of this field to its present state of knowledge will be considered in this review from three angles of vision: mechanistic, functional and evolutionary perspectives. Mechanistic research started on the metabolite level and was initiated by the availability of radioactive nuclides in the early 1950s. By means of sophisticated tracer techniques, the biosynthetic routs of most secondary pathways were outlined and provided the basis for the enzymatic characterization of biosynthetic pathways in the 1970s and 1980s, followed by the identification of the corresponding genes beginning in the late 1980s. During this 50-year period of intensive research a change of paradigm occurred addressing the question: why do plants synthesize this immense rich diversity of secondary metabolites comprising more than 200,000 structures? For a long time regarded as waste products or assigned with various other attributes their indispensable role as components of the survival strategy of plants in a mostly hostile environment appears now generally accepted. Along with the great progress in the field of chemical ecology, the emerging field of molecular evolution provided crucial evidence that during evolution of secondary metabolism genes encoding enzymes of plant's primary metabolism were duplicated, recruited and diversified for new functions under the everlasting and continuously changing selection pressure of the environment.},

abstract = {Strigolactones (SLs) are a group of newly identified plant hormones that control plant shoot branching. SL signalling requires the hormone-dependent interaction of DWARF 14 (D14), a probable candidate SL receptor, with DWARF 3 (D3), an F-box component of the Skp–Cullin–F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Here we report the characterization of a dominant SL-insensitive rice (Oryza sativa) mutant dwarf 53 (d53) and the cloning of D53, which encodes a substrate of the SCFD3 ubiquitination complex and functions as a repressor of SL signalling. Treatments with GR24, a synthetic SL analogue, cause D53 degradation via the proteasome in a manner that requires D14 and the SCFD3 ubiquitin ligase, whereas the dominant form of D53 is resistant to SL-mediated degradation. Moreover, D53 can interact with transcriptional co-repressors known as TOPLESS-RELATED PROTEINS. Our results suggest a model of SL signalling that involves SL-dependent degradation of the D53 repressor mediated by the D14–D3 complex.},

Roots of numerous plant families accumulate and/or synthesize a wide variety of products ranging from the sweet-tasting glycyrrhizic acid of licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra) to the emetic and expectorant principles of ipecac (Cephaelis ipecacuanha). The biosynthesis and mechanisms of accumulation for most of these compounds are poorly understood and the lack of appropriate experimental systems has substantially limited studies on primary and secondary metabolism of roots. This paper reviews recent studies of secondary metabolism in higher plants, with emphasis on the use of organized systems such as the ‘hairy roots' obtained from transformation of plant cells with Agrobacterium rhizogenes. The potential contribution of these novel systems to the production of speciality chemicals through scaled-up cultures is discussed.},

abstract = {Dehydration-responsive element-binding (DREB) transcription factors play critical roles in plant stress responses and signal transduction. To further understand how DREB regulates genes expression to promote cold-hardiness, Illumina/Solexa sequencing technology was used to compare the transcriptomes of non-transgenic and rd29A:RdreB1BI transgenic strawberry plants exposed to low temperatures. Approximately 3.5 million sequence tags were obtained from non-transgenic (NT) and transgenic (T) strawberry untreated (C) or low-temperature treated (LT) leaf samples. Over 1000 genes were differentially expressed between the NT-C and T-C plants, and also the NT-C and NT-LT, as well as the T-C and T-LT plants. Analysis of the genes up-regulated following low-temperature treatment revealed that the majority are linked to metabolism, biosynthesis, transcription and signal transduction. Uniquely up-regulated transcription factors as well as anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway genes are discussed. Accumulation of anthocyanin in the stolon and the base of the petiole differed between non-treated NT and T plants, and this correlated with gene expression patterns. The differentially expressed genes that encode transcription factors and anthocyanin enzymes may contribute to the cold hardiness of RdreB1BI transgenic strawberry. The transcriptome data provide a valuable resource for further studies of strawberry growth and development and DREB-mediated gene regulation under low-temperature stress.},

abstract = {Acacia angustissima is a tropical legume which originated from Central America and has potential as a protein supplement to improve ruminant nutrition if the adverse effects of anti-nutritive factors can be diminished. It has a high nitrogen content and possesses many advantageous growth characteristics such a high leaf yield, drought tolerance, adaptation to acidic infertile soils and large temperature variations. However, the widespread implementation of supplementation practices with A. angustissima is currently impeded by reports of anti-nutritive/toxic effects in feeding trials with both monogastric and ruminant animals. Although the plant contains an array of secondary metabolites in high concentrations there have been few documented reports of toxicity under conventional feeding. The intent of this paper is to review the current knowledge on the secondary plant metabolites in A. angustissima, their toxic and anti-nutritive effects and investigations of rumen microbial interactions with these compounds. Condensed tannins, simple phenolics and non-protein amino acids have been investigated experimentally for their role in the reported toxicity of A. angustissima but recent studies have not been able to establish a definitive link between these classes of compounds and toxicity. Attempts to reproduce toxicity in the ruminant animal have also proved difficult particularly when the plant comprizes less than 300 g/kg of the dry matter intake. Ruminal adaptation to the plant occurs in that the major non-protein amino acids are degraded by rumen microorganisms while the condensed tannins promote populations of organisms which are tolerant to these compounds. In vitro studies indicate that condensed tannins in the plant could severely impair nitrogen digestibilility whereas digestibility trials in ruminants show favourable responses in nitrogen utilization when A. angustissima is provided as a supplement. Further research needs to focus on feeding trials in ruminants which demonstrate the nutritional benefits and toxic potential of this plant at varying inclusion rates in the diet.},

@article{gou_negative_2011,
abstract = {Flavonoids are synthesized through an important metabolic pathway that leads to the production of diverse secondary metabolites, including anthocyanins, flavonols, flavones, and proanthocyanidins. Anthocyanins and flavonols are derived from Phe and share common precursors, dihydroflavonols, which are substrates for both flavonol synthase and dihydroflavonol 4-reductase. In the stems of Arabidopsis thaliana, anthocyanins accumulate in an acropetal manner, with the highest level at the junction between rosette and stem. We show here that this accumulation pattern is under the regulation of miR156-targeted SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE (SPL) genes, which are deeply conserved and known to have important roles in regulating phase change and flowering. Increased miR156 activity promotes accumulation of anthocyanins, whereas reduced miR156 activity results in high levels of flavonols. We further provide evidence that at least one of the miR156 targets, SPL9, negatively regulates anthocyanin accumulation by directly preventing expression of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes through destabilization of a MYB-bHLH-WD40 transcriptional activation complex. Our results reveal a direct link between the transition to flowering and secondary metabolism and provide a potential target for manipulation of anthocyanin and flavonol content in plants.},

abstract = {Seeds of different species are believed to have characteristic shelf lives, although data confirming this are scarce, and a mechanistic understanding of why this should be remains elusive. We have quantified storage performance of c. 42,000 seed accessions, representing 276 species, within the USDA National Plant Germplasm System (NPGS) collection, as well as a smaller experiment of 207 cultivars from 42 species. Accessions from the NPGS collection were harvested between 1934 and 1975, and had relatively high initial germination percentages that decreased at a variable rate during storage at both 5 and –18°C. Germination time courses, which represent the average performance of the species, were fitted to Avrami kinetics, to calculate the time at which germination characteristically declined to 50{\%} (P50). These P50 values correlated with other longevity surveys reported in the literature for seeds stored under controlled conditions, but there was no correlation among these studies and seed persistence observed in the classic buried seed experiment by Duvel. Some plant families had characteristically short-lived (e.g. Apiaceae and Brassicaceae) or long-lived (e.g. Malvaceae and Chenopodiaceae) seeds. Also, seeds from species that originated from particular localities had characteristically short (e.g. Europe) or long (e.g. South Asia and Australia) shelf lives. However, there appeared to be no correlation between longevity and dry matter reserves, soluble carbohydrates and parameters relating to soil persistence or resource allocation. Although data from this survey support the hypothesis that some species tend to survive longer than others in a genebank environment, there is little information on the attributes of the seed that affect its storage performance.},

abstract = {We present here the annotation of the complete genome of rice Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica cultivar Nipponbare. All functional annotations for proteins and non-protein-coding RNA (npRNA) candidates were manually curated. Functions were identified or inferred in 19,969 (70{\%}) of the proteins, and 131 possible npRNAs (including 58 antisense transcripts) were found. Almost 5000 annotated protein-coding genes were found to be disrupted in insertional mutant lines, which will accelerate future experimental validation of the annotations. The rice loci were determined by using cDNA sequences obtained from rice and other representative cereals. Our conservative estimate based on these loci and an extrapolation suggested that the gene number of rice is ∼32,000, which is smaller than previous estimates. We conducted comparative analyses between rice and Arabidopsis thaliana and found that both genomes possessed several lineage-specific genes, which might account for the observed differences between these species, while they had similar sets of predicted functional domains among the protein sequences. A system to control translational efficiency seems to be conserved across large evolutionary distances. Moreover, the evolutionary process of protein-coding genes was examined. Our results suggest that natural selection may have played a role for duplicated genes in both species, so that duplication was suppressed or favored in a manner that depended on the function of a gene.},

abstract = {Seed priming with ascorbic acid improves salt tolerance in durum wheat. For understanding the potential mechanisms underlying this priming effect a gel-free shotgun proteomic analysis was performed comparing unprimed to ascorbate-primed wheat seed during germination under saline and non-saline conditions. Since seed germination is the result of interplay or cross-talk between embryo and embryo-surrounding tissues, we studied the variation of metabolic proteome in both tissues separately. 167 of 697 identified and 69 of 471 identified proteins increase or decrease in abundance significantly in response to priming and/or salinity compared to untreated, unstressed control in embryo and embryo-surrounding tissues, respectively. In untreated wheat embryo salt stress was accompanied by change in 129 proteins, most of which are belonging to metabolism, energy, disease/defense, protein destination and storage categories. Ascorbate pretreatment prevents and counteracts the effects of salinity upon most of these proteins and changes specifically the abundance of 35 others proteins, most of which are involved in metabolism, protein destination and storage categories. Hierarchical clustering analysis revealed three and two major clusters of protein expression in embryo and embryo-surrounding tissues, respectively. This study opens promising new avenues to understand priming-induced salt tolerance in plants.
Biological significance
To clearly understand how ascorbate-priming enhance the salt tolerance of durum wheat during germination, we performed for the first time a comparative shotgun proteomic analysis between unprimed and ascorbate-primed wheat seeds during germination under saline and non-saline conditions. Furthermore, since seed germination is the result of interplay or cross-talk between embryo and embryo-surrounding tissues we analyzed the variation of metabolic proteome in both tissues separately. 1168 proteins exhibiting greater molecular weight diversity (ranging from 5 to 258 kDa) were identified. Among them, 167 and 69 proteins were increased or decreased in abundance significantly by priming and/or salinity as compared to control, in embryo and embryo-surrounding tissues respectively. Ascorbate pretreatment alleviates the effects of salinity upon most of these proteins, particularly those involved in metabolism, energy, disease/defense, protein destination and storage functions. Hierarchical clustering analysis revealed three and two major clusters of protein accumulation in embryo and embryo-surrounding tissues, respectively. These results may provide new avenues for understanding and advancing priming-induced salt tolerance in crop plants.},

abstract = {The chapter discusses the use of genotype-by-environment interaction for crop cultivar development. The chapter begins with definitions of genotype, environment, and phenotype, and discusses the influence of environment on heredity that may result in modification of a phenotype and lead to genotype-environment (GE) interaction. Some terms from ecological genetics are used and explained. The chapter discusses the causes of genotype-environment interaction and ways to deal with it, stability statistics, and ways to exploit or minimize interaction. A crop cultivar development program has two major components—crop breeding methodology and performance evaluation of improved cultivars in target areas. Implications of GE interaction in breeding are discussed. The concepts of stability are presented. Methodology for identifying stable genotypes and environmental factors that may be responsible for stable or unstable performance is also presented. .},

abstract = {A 3-year study was conducted to measure the effect of sowing time and seeding rate on the development and yield of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grown under high-yielding conditions in north-eastern Victoria. A range of wheat cultivars with different development responses, including 'winter' types, was used in 2 experiments in each season. High grain yields for dryland wheat were measured in the first 2 seasons (1985-86), and in 1985, near-optimal water use efficiencies ({\{}{\textgreater}{\}}18 kg/ha. mm effective rainfall) were obtained. In the third season (1987) grain yield was limited by adverse climatic conditions-in the me- and post-anthesis period. In each season, grain yield declined with delay in sowing time. In 1985 there was a loss of 200-250 kg grain/ha for each week's delay in sowing time. In 1987, yield loss with delayed sowing was 50-110 kg grain/ha. In each season, cultivars with late or midseason maturity development gave the highest mean yields, and the use of these maturity types allowed earlier sowing, in mid April. However, with late sowing of wheat there was a trend for early maturity types to give higher yields, and so the use of 2 wheat cultivars with distinct maturity development responses to climate is recommended. If only 1 wheat cultivar is to be used, then a late maturity type is recommended. Higher wheat yields were also obtained as spike density increased, as a result of higher seeding rates. Our data suggest that in the higher rainfall region of north-eastern Victoria, a spike density of about 500 spikes/m2 is required to optimise wheat yields.},

Satellite-observed night lights are used to identify measurement stations located in extreme darkness and adjust temperature trends of urban and periurban stations for nonclimatic factors, verifying that urban effects on analyzed global change are small. Because the GISS analysis combines available sea surface temperature records with meteorological station measurements, we test alternative choices for the ocean data, showing that global temperature change is sensitive to estimated temperature change in polar regions where observations are limited. We use simple 12 month (and n × 12) running means to improve the information content in our temperature graphs. Contrary to a popular misconception, the rate of warming has not declined. Global temperature is rising as fast in the past decade as in the prior 2 decades, despite year-to-year fluctuations associated with the El Ni{\~{n}}o-La Ni{\~{n}}a cycle of tropical ocean temperature. Record high global 12 month running mean temperature for the period with instrumental data was reached in 2010.},

@article{kuyah_allometric_2012,
abstract = {Meeting the reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD) framework demands stringent carbon measuring, reporting and verifying methods. In most cases, estimates of aboveground carbon stocks rely on allometric equations. Although generic and species-specific allometries have been developed for conventional areas such as forests, their use in agricultural landscapes is questionable as agricultural trees are typically managed and rarely mono-specific. Therefore, there is a need to develop a robust generic allometry that accounts for the heterogeneity of tree diversity throughout the landscape. Allometric equations were developed from empirical destructive sampling of 72 trees (diameter at breast height (dbh): 3–102 cm) from three 100 km2 benchmark sites in Western Kenya. Diameter at breast height alone provided reliable prediction for aboveground biomass (17 ± 0.02 Mg C ha−1) with {\textgreater}95{\%} accuracy. Published equations overestimated landscape biomass due to errors in either smaller trees (dbh {\textless}10 cm) which dominate the landscape (66{\%}) or the few larger trees (dbh {\textgreater}40 cm) which constitute 3{\%} of all the trees but hold most of the biomass (48{\%}). The apparently small differences in the equations for small trees could add up to a large amount of carbon when looking at a landscape. This study recommends diameter as the basis for assessing tree biomass in Western Kenyan agricultural mosaics. The equations developed are a useful tool for assessing the potential for carbon sequestration in agricultural landscapes and represent key information for scaling biomass estimates for entire landscapes.},

@article{martre_modeling_2003,
abstract = {A functional explanation for the regulation of grain nitrogen (N) accumulation in cereal by environmental and genetic factors remains elusive. Here, new mechanistic hypotheses of grain N accumulation are proposed and tested for wheat (Triticum aestivum). First, we tested experimentally the hypothesis that grain N accumulation is mostly source regulated. Four contrasting cultivars, in terms of their grain N concentrations and yield potentials, were grown with non-limiting N supply. Grain number per ear was reduced by removing the top part of the ear at anthesis. Reduction in grain number gave a significant increase in N content per grain for all cultivars, showing that grain N accumulation was source regulated. However, on a per ear basis, cultivars with a high grain number fully compensated their N accumulation for reduced grain number at anthesis. Cultivars with a lower grain number did not compensate completely, and grain N per ear was decreased by 16{\%}. Second, new mechanistic hypotheses of the origins of grain N source regulation and its response to environment were tested by simulation. The hypotheses were: (a) The regulation by N sources of grain N accumulation applies only for the storage proteins (i.e. gliadin and glutenin fractions); (b) accumulation of structural and metabolic proteins (i.e. albumin-globulin and amphiphilic fractions) is sink-regulated; and (c) N partitioning between gliadins and glutenins is constant during grain development and unmodified by growing conditions. Comparison of experimental and simulation results of the accumulation of grain protein fractions under wide ranges of N fertilization, temperatures, and irrigation supported these hypotheses.},

abstract = {Plant secondary metabolites are a group of naturally occurring compound classes biosynthesized by differing biochemical pathways whose plant content and regulation is strongly susceptible to environmental influences and to potential herbal predators. Such abiotic and biotic factors might be specifically induced by means of various mechanisms, which create variation in the accumulation or biogenesis of secondary metabolites. Hence the dynamic aspect of bioactive compound synthesis and accumulation enables plants to communicate and react in order to overcome imminent threats. This contribution aims to review the most important mechanisms of various abiotic and biotic interactions, such as pathogenic microorganisms and herbivory, by which plants respond to exogenous influences, and will also report on time-scale variable influences on secondary metabolite profiles. Transmission of signals in plants commonly occurs by ‘semiochemicals', which are comprised of terpenes, phenylpropanoids, benzenoids and other volatile compounds. Due to the important functions of volatile terpenes in communication processes of living organisms, as well as its emission susceptibility relative to exogenous influences, we also present different scenarios of concentration and emission variations. Toxic effects of plants vary depending on the level and type of secondary metabolites. In farming and cattle raising scenarios, the toxicity of plant secondary metabolites and respective concentration shifts may have severe consequences on livestock production and health, culminating in adverse effects on crop yields and/or their human consumers, or have an adverse economic impact. From a wider perspective, herbal medicines, agrochemicals or other natural products are also associated with variability in plant metabolite levels, which can impact the safety and reliable efficacy of these products. We also present typical examples of toxic plants which influence livestock production using Brazilian examples of toxicity of sapogenins and alkaloids on livestock to highlight the problem.},

We tested the hypotheses that natural populations of the well-studied model system Arabidopsis thaliana are locally adapted to spatially coarse-grained environmental variation, and that the photoperiodic regime per se is at least partially responsible for that local adaptation, by exposing natural populations to photoperiodic regimes characteristic of their native and foreign (novel) environments. We also tested the hypothesis that plasticity to novel photoperiodic regimes should appear random. We found that populations showed evidence of local adaptation at a spatially coarse grain, although not to photoperiodic regime per se. We also found that the plasticities to novel photoperiodic regimes appeared random and did not generally show evidence of adaptive divergence. Our study highlights the need for caution in extrapolating from the finding of local adaptation to the causes of local adaptation.},

The seed coats of six varieties of soybeans, covering a wide range of water absorption and stone seed content, were analyzed for ash and cations, protein, lignin, and complex carbohydrates. The water absorption characteristics and macrochemical constituents of the whole seed were also determined. The results indicated that there was no correlation between the concentration of any of the cations and the occurrence of hard seeds. The results from analysis of the complex carbohydrates indicated there were differences in hemicellulose content of seed coat fractions, particularly xylans, that correlated with the water uptake ratio and the occurrence of hard seeds.

abstract = {Application of 100 mmol/L methyl jasmonate (MJ) to the intact bark of 30-yr-old Norway spruce induced anatomical reactions related to defense. Within 30 d, a single MJ treatment induced swelling of existing polyphenolic parenchyma cells (PP cells) and an increase in their phenolic contents and formation of additional PP cells and of traumatic resin ducts (TDs) at the cambial zone. These changes occurred up to 7 cm away from the application zone. Treatment enhanced resin flow and increased resistance to the blue-stain fungus, Ceratocystis polonica. Methyl jasmonate application to the oldest internode of 2-yr-old saplings also induced TD formation, and, more surprisingly, TDs were formed in the untreated internode. Traumatic ducts were not formed in branches, ruling out an effect of volatile MJ on the upper internode. Methyl jasmonate application never gave rise to a hypersensitive response, cell death, tissue necrosis, or wound periderm, indicating the amount of MJ transported across the periderm was very low relative to the application concentration. This is the first report of a single compound giving rise to major cellular features related to acquired resistance and previously shown to be induced by wounding, fungal infection, and bark beetles in Norway spruce.},

abstract = {The developmental pattern of biotinylated proteins (BP) during embryogenesis and maturation of soybean seed was characterized. Detection of these BP was compared with the development of desiccation tolerance in seeds. Three groups of BP were detected in soybean seeds using a biotin-streptavidin detection method: the first group consisted of a set of three bands with a mean apparent MW of 85 kDa (called BP85), detected in crude extracts of embryonic axes (EA) from non-dehydrated seeds (NDS) and from artificially slow-dehydrated seeds (DS); the second one, BP75, was a single protein with an apparent MW of 75 kDa and was expressed in cotyledons (COT) and EA tissues of NDS and DS; the third group with a mean apparent MW of 35 kDa (BP35), was expressed at high levels only in COT of NDS. BP35 concentration was highest in the early stages of seed development (21 days after flowering — DAF) and decreased as seeds developed, being almost imperceptible after 47 DAF. Conversely, only traces of BP75 and BP85 extracted from EA and COT were detected at early stages of seed development (21–33 DAF). Maximum levels of accumulation of these proteins were expressed at 42–47 DAF and remained constant until harvest maturity. Desiccation-tolerant stage of the seeds was initiated at 47 DAF, which coincided with the stage of maximum accumulation of BP75 and BP85 in the seeds, however, appearance of these proteins could be stimulated by desiccation of immature seeds that had not achieved desiccation tolerance. Therefore changes in biotinylated proteins are coincident with, but not sufficient for, the development of desiccation tolerance.},

Assuming the errors to be nonnormal with finite moments, the null distribution of the F-statistic is derived. This differs from its normal theory F-distribution. Besides the sample size and the degrees of freedom of error sum of squares, the major determinant of the sensitivity to nonnormality is the extent of the ‘nonnormality' of the regressors or the extent of presence of ‘leveraged' (influential) observations. The small effect in one direction when all observations are equally influential and the much larger effect in the opposite direction when the observations are extremely heterogeneous in their influences provide extremes of sensitivity within which the sensitivity of the tests will be found. We have identified several specific functions of regressors that can be used to judge the extent of nonnormality of the regressors or the extent of presence of leveraged observations.},

abstract = {In this study, we investigated the allelopathic interactions among five representative allelochemicals at different proportions using bloom-forming Microcystis aeruginosa as the test receptor. Binary or ternary mixtures of allelochemicals obtained three types of allelopathic interactions, i.e., synergistic, antagonistic, and additive effects. However, combinations of four or five allelochemicals only yielded antagonistic effects. Interestingly, the algal inhibition gradually increased with the tested period for all treatments. For instance, the synergistic interaction occurred with the mixture including coumarin + $\rho$-hydroxybenzoic acid at 80{\%}:20{\%}; the mixture on the 10th day showed 0.80 of algal inhibition. While the mixture comprised protocatechuic acid + stearic acid + $\rho$-aminobenzene-sulfonic acid at 33.3{\%}:33.3{\%}:33.3{\%}, the additive interactions occurred and then the maximum algal inhibition (0.83) was acquired at the end of tested period. In conclusion, the joint effects of different allelochemicals depend on various factors such as the chemicals used, their respective proportions, the total concentration of the mixture, and the receptor species. Thus, it is necessary to consider the complexity of allelopathic interactions and the field conditions during the control and management of noxious cyanobacteria.},

In this review we discuss the possibilities and limitations of combining genes from different organisms and the expression of heterologous genes. Major focuses are fundamentals of the genetic work, used expression systems and latest progress in this field. Combinatorial biosynthesis is discussed for important classes of natural products, including alkaloids (vinblastine, vincristine), terpenoids (artemisinin, paclitaxel) and flavonoids. The role and importance of today's used host organisms is critically described, and the latest approaches discussed to give an outlook for future trends and possibilities.},

Drought stress alone or combined with mild fertilization; continuous salicylic acid (SA) application alone or combined with mild fertilization and time course effects of mechanical damage and SA exposure alone and combined were analyzed. Drought stress did not affect final plant biomass, promoted significant increase of uliginosin B (40-fold in the leaves and 6-fold in the reproductive parts), HP1, HP3 and TPC, whereas the stress applied on mild fertilized plants increased biomass and uliginosin B (7.5-fold and 1.5-fold in the leaves and reproductive parts, respectively) and HP3 (4.4-fold in the leaves) concentrations, unaffecting TPC. Continuous application of 2 mM SA alone or combined with mild fertilization resulted in similar increase of uliginosin B and TPC. Time course experiments of mechanical damage with and without SA (10 mM) as well as the treatment with SA induced the biosynthesis of uliginosin B in the leaves, with higher levels verified in wounded plants after 2 days (5-fold) and 7 days (3-folds) of treatment, reducing or not affecting benzopyrans accumulation. The compiled results suggest that a substantial increase of the most important pharmacological active compounds uliginosin B and HP1, associated with higher plant biomass yield can be achieved by modulating drought stress response in fertilized plants.},

abstract = {Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is an important root crop worldwide. It exhibits substantial differential genotypic responses to varying environmental conditions, a phenomenon termed genotype×environment interaction (GEI). A significant GEI presents challenges in the selection of superior genotypes. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of genotype, environment and GEI on early fresh storage root yield (FSRY) and related traits in cassava. Accordingly, 12 cassava genotypes were evaluated in a randomised complete block design at three contrasting locations (Jinja, Nakasongola and Namulonge) in Uganda. Trials were harvested nine months after planting and the data collected were analysed using the additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) model. The AMMI analysis of variance showed significant variation among genotypes for early FSRY and all other traits assessed. Locations were significantly different for all traits except for cassava brown streak disease root necrosis. The GEI effect was non-significant for early FSRY, but significant for other traits. For early FSRY, 48.5{\%} of the treatment sum of squares was attributable to genotypes, 27.3{\%} to environments, and 24.1{\%} to GEI, indicating a predominance of genotypic variation for this trait. Predominance of genotypic variation was also observed for all the other traits. A majority of the genotypes (67{\%}) had low interaction effects with locations for early FSRY, with Akena, CT2, CT4 and NASE14 being the most stable genotypes for the trait. Significant negative correlation was observed between cassava mosaic disease severity and early FSRY and storage root number, indicating significant negative effects of cassava mosaic disease on early FSRY and stability in cassava. The information generated will inform future selection initiatives for superior early-yielding cassava genotypes combining resistance to cassava mosaic and brown streak diseases in Uganda.},

When the environment included in MET is the sample of large environment, then environment effects regarded as random may be preferable, so the model is called mixed model. The assessment of it may be viewed as a problem of prediction rather than estimation. The prediction of the outcome of random variables is commonly done by Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP).Both methods are compared using the experimental rice data set from the Indonesian Rice Consortium's research which aims to evaluate the phenotypic performance of rice (Oryza sativa). Applying postdictive success method resultedAMMI10 as the best model, and its Root Mean Square Error Prediction is smaller than BLUP. AMMI was found to outperform BLUP in this rice dataset.},

abstract = {Localized attack by a necrotizing pathogen induces systemic acquired resistance (SAR) to subsequent attack by a broad range of normally virulent pathogens. Salicylic acid accumulation is required for activation of local defenses, such as pathogenesis-related protein accumulation, at the initial site of attack, and for subsequent expression of SAR upon secondary, distant challenge. Although salicylic acid moves through the plant, it is apparently not an essential mobile signal. We screened Agrobacterium tumefaciens transfer DNA (tDNA) tagged lines of Arabidopsis thaliana for mutants specifically compromized in SAR. Here we show that Defective in induced resistance 1-1 (dir1-1) exhibits wild-type local resistance to avirulent and virulent Pseudomonas syringae, but that pathogenesis-related gene expression is abolished in uninoculated distant leaves and dir1-1 fails to develop SAR to virulent Pseudomonas or Peronospora parasitica. Petiole exudate experiments indicate that dir1-1 is defective in the production or transmission from the inoculated leaf of an essential mobile signal. DIR1 encodes a putative apoplastic lipid transfer protein and we propose that DIR1 interacts with a lipid-derived molecule to promote long distance signalling.},

abstract = {Varroa-vectored virus pandemic
Bees are facing several threats that are causing population collapses. Wilfert et al. found that European honey bees are the primary source of deformed wing virus (DWV) (see the Perspective by Villalobos). However, paradoxically, transmission between bees is inefficient. It seems that parasitic mites can facilitate virus transmission. European honeybees acquired the rapidly spreading Varroa mite from Asian honey bees, possibly via the commercial exchange of queens. Not only do bees suffer direct damage from the mites, but the bees are also efficiently inoculated with DWV.
Science, this issue p. 594; see also p. 554
Deformed wing virus (DWV) and its vector, the mite Varroa destructor, are a major threat to the world's honeybees. Although the impact of Varroa on colony-level DWV epidemiology is evident, we have little understanding of wider DWV epidemiology and the role that Varroa has played in its global spread. A phylogeographic analysis shows that DWV is globally distributed in honeybees, having recently spread from a common source, the European honeybee Apis mellifera. DWV exhibits epidemic growth and transmission that is predominantly mediated by European and North American honeybee populations and driven by trade and movement of honeybee colonies. DWV is now an important reemerging pathogen of honeybees, which are undergoing a worldwide manmade epidemic fueled by the direct transmission route that the Varroa mite provides.
Pandemic virus infection in honeybees has been facilitated by the recent spread of a parasitic mite and by human trade. [Also see Perspective by Villalobos]

abstract = {In this review, we provide an overview of the role of glucosinolates and other phytochemical compounds present in the Brassicaceae in relation to plant protection and human health. Current knowledge of the factors that influence phytochemical content and profile in the Brassicaceae is also summarized and multi-factorial approaches are briefly discussed. Variation in agronomic conditions (plant species, cultivar, developmental stage, plant organ, plant competition, fertilization, pH), season, climatic factors, water availability, light (intensity, quality, duration) and CO2 are known to significantly affect content and profile of phytochemicals. Phytochemicals such as the glucosinolates and leaf surface waxes play an important role in interactions with pests and pathogens. Factors that affect production of phytochemicals are important when designing plant protection strategies that exploit these compounds to minimize crop damage caused by plant pests and pathogens. Brassicaceous plants are consumed increasingly for possible health benefits, for example, glucosinolate-derived effects on degenerative diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, factors influencing phytochemical content and profile in the production of brassicaceous plants are worth considering both for plant and human health. Even though it is known that factors that influence phytochemical content and profile may interact, studies of plant compounds were, until recently, restricted by methods allowing only a reductionistic approach. It is now possible to design multi-factorial experiments that simulate their combined effects. This will provide important information to ecologists, plant breeders and agronomists.},

abstract = {During germination and early growth of the seedling, storage proteins are degraded by proteases. Currently, limited information is available on the degradation of storage proteins in the soybean during germination. In this study, a combined two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry approach was utilized to determine the proteome profile of soybean seeds (Glycine max L.; Eunhakong). Comparative analysis showed that the temporal profiles of protein expression are dramatically changed during the seed germination and seedling growth. More than 80{\%} of the proteins identified were subunits of glycinin and $\beta$-conglycinin, two major storage proteins. Most subunits of these proteins were degraded almost completely at a different rate by 120 h, and the degradation products were accumulated or degraded further. Interestingly, the acidic subunits of glycinin were rapidly degraded, but no obvious change in the basic chains. Of the five acidic subunits, the degradation of G2 subunit was not apparently affected by at least 96 h but the levels decreased rapidly after that, while no newly appearing intermediate was detected upon the degradation of G4 subunit. On the other hand, the degradation of $\beta$-conglycinin during storage protein mobilization appeared to be similar to that of glycinin but at a faster rate. Both $\alpha$ and $\alpha$' subunits of $\beta$-conglycinin largely disappeared by 96 h, while the $\beta$ subunits degraded at the slowest rate. These results suggest that mobilization of subunits of the storage proteins is differentially regulated for seed germination and seedling growth. The present proteomic analysis will facilitate future studies addressing the complex biochemical events taking place during soybean seed germination.},

abstract = {The dwarfing gene Rht8 and the photoperiodic insensitivity gene Ppd-D1 are linked on the short arm of chromosome 2D of bread wheat and play an important role in determining the geographic adaptation of modern wheat varieties. The genes are believed to originate from the old Japanese variety 'Akakomugi' and have been distributed throughout the world by diverse breeding programmes. Twelve microsatellite loci previously mapped on wheat chromosome 2D were used for a retrospective analysis of 59 wheat varieties with known pedigree, to trace the transmittance of the chromosomal region around these genes during extended breeding programmes. Within the range of the screened varieties 100 alleles were detected at the 12 microsatellite loci. For each microsatellite locus, a screen over varieties was performed to find the alleles corresponding to the parental variety 'Akakomugi'. A comparison of wheat varieties carrying the 192-bp allele, at locus Xgwm261-2D which is diagnostic for the presence of the gene Rht8 , with the varieties without Rht8 , showed linkage disequilibrium of 'Akakomugi' alleles for a segment of chromosome 2D which comprised at least 28 cM. Selection was accompanied with a linkage drag of 'Akakomugi' alleles in the neighbouring loci to Rht8 . A diminution of the segment of chromosome 2D originating from 'Akakomugi' during several pedigree generations was observed. Varieties of the early generations were found to carry the whole short arm of chromosome 2D of 'Akakomugi', while the varieties of further selections possessed smaller segments including the diagnostic allele at locus Xgwm261-2D . Our results demonstrate that microsatellites can be successfully used for studying the inheritance of chromosomes within pedigrees of breeding programmes.},

abstract = {Apples with red fruit flesh are desirable for breeding because they contain more health-beneficial compounds. That color trait is also considered more attractive to consumer. To obtain experimental evidence about the molecular mechanism for this pigmentation, we investigated how the practice of bagging fruit might affect levels of phenolic compounds as well as the expression of anthocyanin biosynthetic and regulatory genes. Two red-fleshed varieties from Xinjiang, P.R. China, were studied – ‘Xiahongrou' and ‘No.1 Hongxun'. HPLC analysis showed that the contents of anthocyanins in both peel and flesh were decreased by bagging, but were increased again when fruits were re-exposed to sunlight. Except for F3H in ‘No.1 Hongxun', transcription levels for most anthocyanin biosynthetic genes in the flesh were enhanced after bag removal. MYB10 is a key transcriptional factor in the anthocyanin pathway of these two apple varieties, particularly in the flesh. These results suggest that the development of red coloring when bags are removed could be a result of light-induced coordinated expression by MYB10 and anthocyanin biosynthetic genes in red-fleshed apples.},

abstract = {To understand gene expression networks leading to functional properties and compositional traits of the soybean seed, we have undertaken a detailed examination of soybean seed development from a few days post-fertilization to the mature seed using Illumina high-throughput transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq). RNA was sequenced from seven different stages of seed development, yielding between 12 million and 78 million sequenced transcripts. These have been aligned to the 79,000 gene models predicted from the soybean genome recently sequenced by the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute. Over one hundred gene models were identified with high expression exclusively in young seed stages, starting at just four days after fertilization. These were annotated as being related to many basic components and processes such as histones and proline-rich proteins. Genes encoding storage proteins such as glycinin and beta-conglycinin had their highest expression levels at the stages of largest fresh weight, confirming previous knowledge that these storage products are being rapidly accumulated before the seed begins the desiccation process. Other gene models showed high expression in the dry, mature seeds, perhaps indicating the preparation of pathways needed later, in the early stages of imbibition. Many highly-expressed gene models at the dry seed stage are, as expected, annotated as hydrophilic proteins associated with low water conditions, such as late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins and dehydrins, which help preserve the cellular structures and nutrients within the seed during desiccation. More significantly, the power of RNA-Seq to detect genes expressed at low levels revealed hundreds of transcription factors with notable expression in at least one stage of seed development. Results from a second biological replicate demonstrate high reproducibility of these data revealing a comprehensive view of the transciptome of seed development in the cultivar Williams, the reference cultivar for the first soybean genome sequence.},

abstract = {Strawberry production requires the input of large amounts of water and its cultivation under plastic tunnels, relies entirely on water provided by irrigation during the production cycle. In these systems, water management is not easy, since soils are very poor and with low water holding capacity (sandy soils), and growers tend to use excessively and inadequately supplied water. This is especially tough at Huelva (the most important strawberry cropping area in Europe), where water is scarce and its use for irrigation is limited. Knowledge of water requirements of the main competitive strawberry cultivars of the region and their physiological and agronomical response to possible restrictions on water supply is required to keep its environmental sustainability. In this sense, no information pertaining to water requirements, crop-water use efficiency (WUEc) and to the relative response to water shortage of the main strawberry cultivars currently growing in Huelva is available. Two experimental designs were carried out for the comparative evaluation of water requirements of seven strawberry cultivars (Fragaria × ananassa Duch.) and of their physiological and growth response to water shortage (70{\%} ETc). Main results showed that water consumption differs substantially among cultivars and these differences were associated with differences in the biomass partitioning into the harvest product (i.e. harvest index; HI) and in the transpiration efficiency of the standing biomass (TEv) closely related to instantaneous water use efficiency (A/T). Cultivars were segregated on the basis of the relationship between both parameters, which integrate the differences among cultivars at the physiological (chlorophyll fluorescence, gas exchange, SPAD index, etc.) and at the growth response (fruit production, patterns of carbon allocation, LMA) levels in both water treatments. It is concluded that, in horticultural crops, such strawberry, greater leaf-level water use efficiency is not always an agronomical advantage in terms of water use.},

There is a clear philosophy, a sound criterion based in information theory, and a rigorous statistical foundation for AIC. AIC can be justified as Bayesian using a “savvy” prior on models that is a function of sample size and the number of model parameters. Furthermore, BIC can be derived as a non-Bayesian result. Therefore, arguments about using AIC versus BIC for model selection cannot be from a Bayes versus frequentist perspective. The philosophical context of what is assumed about reality, approximating models, and the intent of model-based inference should determine whether AIC or BIC is used. Various facets of such multimodel inference are presented here, particularly methods of model averaging.},

abstract = {Rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations can affect the induced defense of plants against herbivory by chewing insects, but little is known about whether elevated CO2 can change the inducible defense of plants against herbivory by aphids, which are phloem-sucking rather than tissue-chewing insects. Interactions between the green peach aphid Myzus persicae and four isogenic Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes including wild type and three induced defense pathway deficient mutants were examined under ambient and elevated CO2. Our data showed that elevated CO2 increased the population abundance of peach aphid when reared on wild type and SA-deficient mutant plants. Regardless of aphid infestation, elevated CO2 decreased the jasmonic acid (JA) but increased the salicylic acid (SA) level in wild-type plants. In addition, elevated CO2 increased SA level in SA-deficient mutant while did not change the JA level in JA-deficient mutant. Pathway enrichment analysis based on high-throughput transcriptome sequencing suggested that CO2 level, aphid infestation, and their interactions (respectively) altered plant defense pathways. Furthermore, qPCR results showed that elevated CO2 up-regulated the expression of SA-dependent defense genes but down-regulated the expression of JA/ethylene-dependent defense genes in wild-type plants infested by aphids. The current study indicated that elevated CO2 tended to enhance the ineffective defense-SA signaling pathway and to reduce the effective defense-JA signaling pathway against aphids, which resulted in increased aphid numbers.},

We found that in the cropping regions and growing seasons of most countries, with the important exception of the United States, temperature trends from 1980 to 2008 exceeded one standard deviation of historic year-to-year variability. Models that link yields of the four largest commodity crops to weather indicate that global maize and wheat production declined by 3.8 and 5.5{\%}, respectively, relative to a counterfactual without climate trends. For soybeans and rice, winners and losers largely balanced out. Climate trends were large enough in some countries to offset a significant portion of the increases in average yields that arose from technology, carbon dioxide fertilization, and other factors.
Climate change has decreased global maize and wheat production, while soybean and rice production have remained stable.

@article{doebley_teosinte_1995,
abstract = {Two quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling differences in plant and inflorescence architecture between maize and its progenitor (teosinte) were analyzed. Complementation tests indicate that one of these, which is on chromosome arm 1L, is the locus for the maize mutant teosinte branched1 (tb1). This QTL has effects on inflorescence sex and the number and length of internodes in the lateral branches and inflorescences. This QTL has strong phenotypic effects in teosinte background but reduced effects in maize background. The second QTL, which is on chromosome arm 3L, affects the same traits as the QTL on 1L. We identify two candidate loci for this QTL. The effects of this QTL on several traits are reduced in both maize and teosinte background as compared to a maize-teosinte F2 population. Genetic background appears to affect gene action for both QTL. Analysis of a population in which both QTL were segregating revealed that they interact epistatically. Together, these two QTL substantially transform both plant and inflorescence architecture. We propose that tb1 is involved in the plant's response to local environment to produce either long or short branches and that maize evolution involved a change at this locus to produce short branches under all environments.},

abstract = {In spite of some inherent challenges, metabolite profiling is becoming increasingly popular under field conditions. It has been used successfully to address topics like species interactions, connections between growth and chemical stoichiometry or the plant's stress response. Stress exerts a particularly clear impact on plant metabolomes and has become a central topic in many metabolite profiling experiments in the fields. In contrast to phytochambers, however, external stress is often at least partially absorbed by the environment when measuring under field conditions. Such stress-buffering capacities of (agro)-ecosystems are of crucial interest given the ever-increasing anthropogenic impact on ecosystems and this review promotes the idea of using plant metabolite profiles for respective measurements. More specifically I propose to use parameters of the response of key plant species to a given stress treatment as proxies for measuring and comparing stress-buffering capacities of ecosystems. Stress response parameters accessible by metabolite profiling comprise for example the intensity or duration of the impact of stress or the ability of the plant organism to recover from this impact after a given time. Analyses of ecosystem stress-buffering capacities may improve our understanding of how ecosystems cope with stress and may improve our abilities to predict ecosystem changes.},

abstract = {Owing to the exponential growth of genome databases, phylogenetic trees are now widely used to test a variety of evolutionary hypotheses. Nevertheless, computation time burden limits the application of methods such as maximum likelihood nonparametric bootstrap to assess reliability of evolutionary trees. As an alternative, the much faster Bayesian inference of phylogeny, which expresses branch support as posterior probabilities, has been introduced. However, marked discrepancies exist between nonparametric bootstrap proportions and Bayesian posterior probabilities, leading to difficulties in the interpretation of sometimes strongly conflicting results. As an attempt to reconcile these two indices of node reliability, we apply the nonparametric bootstrap resampling procedure to the Bayesian approach. The correlation between posterior probabilities, bootstrap maximum likelihood percentages, and bootstrapped posterior probabilities was studied for eight highly diverse empirical data sets and were also investigated using experimental simulation. Our results show that the relation between posterior probabilities and bootstrapped maximum likelihood percentages is highly variable but that very strong correlations always exist when Bayesian node support is estimated on bootstrapped character matrices. Moreover, simulations corroborate empirical observations in suggesting that, being more conservative, the bootstrap approach might be less prone to strongly supporting a false phylogenetic hypothesis. Thus, apparent conflicts in topology recovered by the Bayesian approach were reduced after bootstrapping. Both posterior probabilities and bootstrap supports are of great interest to phylogeny as potential upper and lower bounds of node reliability, but they are surely not interchangeable and cannot be directly compared.},

However, little information is known about the physiological determinations of yield in DT hybrids. Our objective was to assess radiation-use efficiency (RUE), biomass production, and yield in two hybrids differing in drought tolerance. Field experiments were conducted in 2013 and 2014 with two hybrids, P1151HR (DT hybrid) and 33D49 (conventional hybrid) under well-watered (I100) and drought (I50) conditions. I100 and I50 refer to 100 {\%} and 50 {\%} evapotranspiration requirement, respectively. On average, P1151HR yielded 11–27 {\%} greater than 33D49 at I100 and about 40 {\%} greater at I50, At I100, greater yield in P1151HR was due to greater biomass at physiological maturity (BMpm) resulting from greater post-silking biomass accumulation (BMpost). At I50, both hybrids had similar BMpm but P1151HR showed a higher harvest index and greater BMpost. RUE differed significantly (P {\{}{\textless}{\}} 0.05) between the hybrids at I100, but not at I50. At I100, the RUE values for P1151HR and 33D49 were 4.87 and 4.28 g MJ−1 in 2013, and 3.71 and 3.48 g MJ−1 in 2014. At I50, the mean RUE was 3.89 g MJ−1 in 2013 and 3.16 g MJ−1 in 2014. Results indicate that BMpost is important for maintaining high yield in DT maize.},

@article{haig_seed_????,
abstract = {Summary Seed plants capture pollen before seeds are dispersed and abort unpollinated ovules. As a result, each seed is associated with an accessory cost that represents the costs of pollen capture and the costs of aborted ovules. Accessory costs may explain the minimum seed size among species, because these costs are likely to comprise a greater proportion of total reproductive allocation in species with smaller seeds. For very small propagules, the costs of pollination may not be worth the benefits, perhaps explaining the persistence of pteridophytic reproduction at small propagule sizes. The smallest angiosperm seeds are much smaller than the smallest gymnosperm seeds, both in the fossil record and in the modern flora. This suggests that angiosperms can produce pollinated ovules more cheaply than gymnosperms. Pollination becomes less efficient as a species decreases in abundance, and this loss of efficiency is greater for species with a higher accessory cost per seed. We propose that the greater reproductive efficiency of angiosperms when rare can explain why angiosperm-dominated floras were more speciose than the gymnosperm-dominated floras they replaced.},

Correlation coefficients between arrays of mean downy mildew incidence from different pairs of subsets ranged from 0.57 to 0.98 and those of deviation mean squares from 0.58 to 0.96 indicating good repeatability of these parameters. Arrays of regression coefficients from different subsets, on the other hand, showed correlation coefficients that ranged from -0.58 to 0.96. Apparently, the regression index of stability was not repeatable for the genotypes and environments studied. Therefore, in order to identify a widely adapted genotype, testing is required to be carried out over a wider range of environments.},

From total dry weights and leaf areas determined at intervals during the first exponential phase of growth, we used mathematical growth analysis techniques to calculate net assimilation rates (NAR), relative growth rates (Rw), relative leaf area expansion rates (Ra), leaf area partition coefficients (LAP), and leaf area ratios (LAR). In all four species, Rw, Ra, and NAR decreased with decreasing growth irradiance, while LAP and LAR increased. Within each species, Rw was positively correlated with NAR but negatively correlated with LAP and LAR. In comparisons among the four species within each growth irradiance, Rw was positively correlated with LAP. We discuss the relationship between LAP and LAR and show that LAP = (Ra/Rw) (LAR).},

Recent advances have been made in regard to metabolite production by plant microsymbionts showing that they may produce a range of different types of metabolites. These substances play a role in defense and competition, but may also be needed for specific interaction and communication with the plant host. Furthermore, few examples of bilateral metabolite production are known and endophytes may modulate plant metabolite synthesis as well. We have just started to understand such metabolic interactions between plants and endophytes, however, further research is needed to more efficiently make use of beneficial plant-microbe interactions and to reduce pathogen infestation as well as to reveal novel bioactive substances of commercial interest.},

We studied the impact of different degrees of pearling (0, 3, 6, 9 and 12{\%} by weight) on the composition of pearlings and bran obtained when subsequently roller milling pearled wheat kernels. Pearling does not remove the kernel outer tissues homogeneously as abrasion affects especially the accessible parts of the kernels. Nevertheless, the first 3{\%} removed consisted of mainly pericarp. With 6{\%} or more removed, a significant amount of starchy endosperm ended up in the pearlings. The starting bran material and bran obtained by subsequent roller milling of pearled wheat kernels had similar compositions but the latter had a lower average particle size. Moreover, removal of the outermost kernel layers substantially decreased the enzyme activity levels in the bran.},

abstract = {We used in situ hybridization to investigate Kunitz trypsin inhibitor gene expression programs at the cell level in soybean embryos and in transformed tobacco seeds. The major Kunitz trypsin inhibitor mRNA, designated as KTi3, is first detectable in a specific globular stage embryo region, and then becomes localized within the axis of heart, cotyledon, and maturation stage embryos. By contrast, a related Kunitz trypsin inhibitor mRNA class, designated as KTi1/2, is not detectable during early embryogenesis. Nor is the KTi1/2 mRNA detectable in the axis at later developmental stages. Outer perimeter cells of each cotyledon accumulate both KTi1/2 and KTi3 mRNAs early in maturation. These mRNAs accumulate progressively from the outside to inside of each cotyledon in a "wave-like" pattern as embryogenesis proceeds. A similar KTi3 mRNA localization pattern is observed in soybean somatic embryos and in transformed tobacco seeds. An unrelated mRNA, encoding [beta]-conglycinin storage protein, also accumulates in a wave-like pattern during soybean embryogenesis. Our results indicate that cell-specific differences in seed protein gene expression programs are established early in development, and that seed protein mRNAs accumulate in a precise cellular pattern during seed maturation. We also show that seed protein gene expression patterns are conserved at the cell level in embryos of distantly related plants, and that these patterns are established in the absence of non-embryonic tissues.},

Dry matter intake, nutrient intake, milk yield, and yield of milk fat and protein of predominantly Holstein-Friesian dairy cows in late lactation consuming 3 herbage-based diets (4 replicates per treatment) were measured. The 3 grazed herbages were second-year chicory (CHIC) and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.; PRG) monocultures and a mixed sward ({\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}50:50) of chicory and perennial ryegrass (MIX). All diets (CHIC, PRG, and MIX) were supplemented with alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) hay (5.5 kg of DM/cow per day) and an energy-based concentrate pellet (4.0 kg of DM/cow per day). There were no significant differences in milk yield (12.0 to 12.6 kg/d across the treatments) or the yield of milk fat (539 to 585 g/d) and milk protein (433 to 447 g/d) between the 3 herbage-based diets. No differences in DMI (17.9 to 19.2 kg/d) or estimated metabolizable energy intake (173 to 185 MJ/d) were noted between treatments. Estimated metabolizable energy concentrations in the forages on offer were lower in CHIC than PRG (7.6 vs. 8.2 MJ/kg of dry matter), but the concentration in consumed herbage was not different (9.1 vs. 9.2 MJ/kg of dry matter); as such, potential for increased milk yield in cows offered CHIC was limited. Increased concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids was observed in chicory herbage compared with perennial ryegrass. This was associated with increased milk conjugated linoleic acid and milk polyunsaturated fatty acids when chicory formed part of the diet (CHIC compared to PRG and MIX). Chicory could be used as an alternative to perennial ryegrass in summer; however, the developmental stage of chicory will influence concentrations of metabolizable energy and neutral detergent fiber and, therefore, intake and milk production responses compared with perennial ryegrass.},

abstract = {Herbivory initiates a shift in plant metabolism from growth to defence that may reduce fitness in the absence of further herbivory. However, the defence-induced changes in carbon assimilation that precede this reallocation in resources remain largely undetermined. This study characterized the response of photosynthesis to herbivore induction of jasmonic acid (JA)-related defences in Nicotiana attenuata to increase understanding of these mechanisms. It was hypothesized that JA-induced defences would immediately reduce the component processes of photosynthesis upon attack and was predicted that wild-type plants would suffer greater reductions in photosynthesis than plants lacking JA-induced defences. Gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and thermal spatial patterns were measured together with the production of defence-related metabolites after attack and through recovery. Herbivore damage immediately reduced electron transport and gas exchange in wild-type plants, and gas exchange remained suppressed for several days after attack. The sustained reductions in gas exchange occurred concurrently with increased defence metabolites in wild-type plants, whereas plants lacking JA-induced defences suffered minimal suppression in photosynthesis and no increase in defence metabolite production. This suppression in photosynthesis occurred only after sustained defence signalling and defence chemical mobilization, whereas a short bout of feeding damage only transiently altered components of photosynthesis. It was identified that lipoxygenase signalling interacted with photosynthetic electron transport and that the resulting JA-related metabolites reduced photosynthesis. These data represent a metabolic cost to mounting a chemical defence against herbivory and link defence-signalling networks to the differential effects of herbivory on photosynthesis in remaining leaf tissues in a time-dependent manner.},

abstract = {Seed germination is a critical life stage for plants survival and timely seedling establishment especially in stressful environments. We hypothesized that fungal endophytes would improve wheat seed germination under heat and drought stress. The hydrothermal time (HTT) model of germination is a conceptual model useful for predicting the timing and energy of germination (EG) under a given set of conditions. The HTT and EG are applied, for the first time, to determine if one or more compatible endophytic fungi enhance heat or drought tolerance in wheat. Fungal endophytes tested dramatically increased the percent of germination, improved EG and HTT values, and diminished wheat susceptibility to heat and drought as measured by fresh weight of seedlings. When colonized by the most effective fungal endophyte, the values of the parameters tested in wheat seeds exposed to heat stress resembled those of unstressed seeds., La germination des graines constitue un stade critique du cycle vital pour la survie des plantes et l'{\'{e}}tablissement des plantules au bon moment, surtout dans des milieux stressants.

abstract = {The classic, multivariate technique of principal component analysis can be used to find and estimate the directions of lines and planes of best least-squares fit along the demagnetization path of a palaeomagnetic specimen, thereby replacing vector subtraction, remagnetization circles and difference vector paths with one procedure. Eigenvalues from the analysis are the variance of the data along each principal axis, and provide a relative measure of collinearity or coplanarity which may be used to define a general palaeomagnetic precision index. Demagnetization planes found with principal component analysis may be used in place of difference vector paths for locating Hoffman—Day directions, avoiding unnecessary vector subtraction and intensity truncation steps. Two methods are discussed for jointly estimating an average remanence direction from demagnetization lines and planes.},

@article{pausch_use_1996-4,
abstract = {Short- and long-term C uptake/transaction dynamics were studied using stable isotope techniques and leaf gas exchange to investigate the mechanism(s) of O3 action on plant yield and C partitioning.

Glycine max (L.) Merr. (soybean) plants were grown in open-top chambers and exposed to one of three O3 regimes: half-ambient, ambient, or 2 × ambient for nearly the entire growing season. The seasonal 7 h average O3 concentrations (nl l−1) were 25, 43, and 76 nl l−1, respectively. Whole plant C translocation was measured using pulse-labeled 13CO2 (99 atom {\%}13C) at two distant growth stages (R2 and R5). Translocation parameters were as follows: {\%}13C (sink strength), {\%} 13C/g dry weight (sink intensity), and {\%} 13C/{\%} organ dry weight (relative specific uptake). Single leaf photosynthesis (Pn) was measured at four growth stages (V7, R2, R3, and R4).

Ozone significantly affected translocation, but the effect was dependent upon growth stage and the time following the 13C pulse. At the stage of rapid seed fill within the pods (R5), and at 42 h post-labeling, all three leaf translocation parameters had a significant positive linear relationship with O3 exposure. Conversely, root nodule values were all inversely related to O3 exposure. Generally, at 0.5 h post-labeling, no significant effects were observed for leaves and nodule translocation patterns, with the exception of an inverse relationship between sink strength and O3 exposure. No significant differences were observed for single leaf Pn among treatments.

Our results indicate that the mechanism of chronic O3 action involves inhibition of translocation, implying reduced phloem loading and the inhibition may be occurring without a concomitant reduction in the amount of C fixed. In addition, 13C pulse labeling appears to be a very useful technique for investigating integrated long-term C translocation dynamics which might not otherwise be evident using instantaneous methods such as short-term labeling or limited leaf gas exchange measurements.},

@article{Gilissen2016,
abstract = {The water-insoluble storage proteins of cereals (prolamins) are called “gluten” in wheat, barley, and rye, and “avenins” in oat. Gluten can provoke celiac disease (CD) in genetically susceptible individuals (those with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 serotypes). Avenins are present at a lower concentration (10{\%}–15{\%} of total protein content) in oat as compared to gluten in wheat (80{\%}–85{\%}). The avenins in the genus Avena (cultivated oat as well as various wild species of which gene bank accessions were analyzed) are free of the known CD immunogenic epitopes from wheat, barley, and rye. T cells that recognize avenin-specific epitopes have been found very rarely in CD patients. CD patients that consume oats daily do not show significantly increased levels of intraepithelial lymphocyte (EIL) cells. The safety and the positive health effects of the long-term inclusion of oats in the gluten-free diet have been confirmed in long-term studies. Since 2009 (EC 41/2009) and 2013 (FDA) oat products may be sold as gluten-free in several countries provided a gluten contamination level below 20 ppm. Introduction of oats in the gluten-free diet of celiac patients is advised after the recovery of the intestine. Health effects of oat consumption are reflected in European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)- and Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved health claims. Oats can form a healthy, nutritious, fiber-rich, and safe complement to the gluten-free diet.},

@article{spencer_influence_1990,
abstract = {Potamogeton gramineus L., growing in a northern California irrigation canal, was reddish-brown due to the presence of anthocyanin pigments. Tissue N and P were positively correlated with relative anthocyanin content. This suggests that anthocyanins did not accumulate due to N or P limitation. The anthocyanin content of P. gramineus grown in Byrnes Canal sediment, in the canal or in a greenhouse, was also unaffected by the addition of N, P, or N and P. Inorganic N concentrations in sediment samples from the Byrnes Canal were {\{}{\textgreater}{\}} 11 mg kg−1, which was the level of inorganic N associated with increased anthocyanin production in a greenhouse study. The addition of Fe to Byrnes Canal sediments did not influence the relative anthocyanin content of P. gramineus grown in the canal. P. gramineus grown at 25 combinations of temperature (10, 15, 25, 30 and 35°C) and light (8, 15, 22, 58 and 189 $\mu$mol m−2 s−1) in laboratory cultures exhibited greater changes in relative chlorophyll content than in relative anthocyanin content. In general, chlorophyll decreased sharply with increasing light while anthocyanin increased slightly. In the context of the light and temperature conditions prevalent in the Byrnes Canal, the reddish-brown color of P. gramineus appears to be the consequence of a decrease in relative chlorophyll content which unmasks the anthocyanins.},

@article{fletcher_growth_1974,
abstract = {Examination of the stem apex of Proctor barley showed that the bud of the coleoptile tiller, Tc, is probably present in the dry grain and that the bud, TI, carried in the axil of the first leaf is present at or soon after 24 h from planting. Subsequently tiller buds are initiated with a plastochron of about 4 days, this being rather longer than that for the foliar primordia. During the initial phase of bud growth vascular connections are established with the leaf above, but not to the subtending leaf. At some time after these vascular connections are formed and when it has a dry weight of 4–7 $\mu$g the bud enters a phase of rapid, exponential growth in dry weight.
Shading the first leaf delays the onset of rapid growth for both Tc and Ti, but after a lag period rapid growth commences; this is coincident with development of the second leaf as an organ exporting assimilated carbon.
The phase of rapid growth of tiller buds is delayed when application of either nitrogenous or nonnitrogenous minerals is delayed. Ammonium was found to be less satisfactory as a nitrogen source than nitrate, probably because of toxicity effects. Slight growth of Tc and T1 occurs in presence of nonnitrogenous minerals and absence of nitrogen but growth is greater when nitrogen is supplied in absence of the other minerals, although such growth is substantially less than that found when all nutrients are supplied. The interaction between nitrogen and non-nitrogenous minerals which controls bud growth was not found to affect growth of the parent plant which is, as previously shown, controlled by timing of the nitrogen supply. AnotheT distinction is that higher concentrations of nitrogen and the other minerals are required for maximum growth of the bud than for that of the plant.
Tiller bud growth is interpreted as occurring in two phases. In the first, initiation, phase there is a close association with the subtending leaf, and nutritionally bud and leaf are linked. This phase is followed by one in which the bud is directly connected by vascular traces to the leaf above, which because of this controls bud growth by modulating supply of assimilated carbon and nitrogen, and other minerals to it.},

abstract = {Phytoalexins are compounds synthesized by plants in response to extrinsic stress such as microbial attack and physical injury. Some members of the Poaceae, including cereal crops rice, maize and sorghum, are known to produce substantial amounts of structurally diverse groups of phytoalexins. However, no phytoalexin has been identified in other cereals such as wheat and barley although they possess certain phytoalexin biosynthetic genes. Phytoalexins identified in the cereal food Poaceae include the momilactones, oryzalexins, phytocassanes and sakuranetin from rice; the kauralexins and zealexins from maize; and the 3-deoxyanthocyanidins from sorghum. These phytoalexins are known to exhibit considerable antimicrobial activities against a wide array of pathogenic fungi and bacteria. Despite their prospects for use as naturally derived antimicrobial agents, there is scarcity of information on the application of these inducible compounds in the food system. Since food wastage due to spoilage microorganisms constitutes a challenge in global food security, these phytoalexins can potentially be utilized as sustainable natural antimicrobial food preservatives considering the abundance of their sources. This paper reviews the chemistry, biosynthesis and antimicrobial activities of phytoalexins from the cereal food Poaceae, and highlights their potential application in food preservation.},

abstract = {Ammonia (NH(3)) volatilization from a paddy field following applications of urea was measured. Two lysimeters of Gray Lowland soil with a pH (H(2)O) of 5.7 were used for the experiment. Urea was applied at a rate of 50 kg N ha(-1) by incorporation as the basal fertilization (BF) and at rates of 30 and 10 kg N ha(-1) by top-dressing as the first (SF1) and second (SF2) supplemental fertilizations, respectively. Two wind tunnels per lysimeter were installed just after BF; one was transplanted with rice plants (PR plot), and the other was without rice plants (NR plot). Weak volatilization was observed at the PR plots after BF. By contrast, strong volatilization was observed at the PR plots after SF1 with a maximum flux of 150 g N ha(-1) h(-1); however, almost no volatilization was observed after SF2. The NH(3) volatilization loss accounted for 2.1{\%}, 20.9{\%}, 0.5{\%}, and 8.2{\%} of the applied urea at each application, BF, SF1, SF2, and the total application, respectively, for which only the net fluxes as volatilization were accumulated. The NH(3) volatilization fluxes from the paddy water surface (F(vol)) at the NR plots were estimated using a film model for its verification. After confirmation of good correlation, the film model was applied to estimate F(vol) at the PR plots. The NH(3) exchange fluxes by rice plants (F(ric)) were obtained by subtracting F(vol) from the observed net NH(3) flux. The derived F(ric) showed that the rice plants emitted NH(3) remarkably just after SF1 when a relatively high rate of urea was applied, although they absorbed atmospheric NH(3) in the other periods. In conclusion, rice plants are essentially an absorber of atmospheric NH(3); however, they turn into an emitter of NH(3) under excess nutrition of ammoniacal nitrogen.},

abstract = {In Kenya, Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) is mostly grown in ponds. To avoid excessive reproduction and stunted growth, fingerlings are treated with methyl-testosterone to make all-male populations (monosex). For a national breeding programme that aims to provide genetically improved broodstock to hatcheries that supply monosex fry to smallholder pond farmers, it is important to assess the genetic correlation (rg) for traits between the mixed sex breeding candidates from the breeding nucleus and monosex production fish. The purpose of the study was to estimate genetic parameters for harvest weight (HW), daily growth coefficient (DGC) and body shape and investigate genotype by environment interaction (G×E) for these traits between mixed sex and monosex populations. Forty-eight sires and 76 dams from the F2 generation of a local O. niloticus strain, kept at Sagana Aquaculture Research Station, Kenya were used to produce 76 full-sib families. Mixed sex fry (3days old) from each full sib family were divided into two groups of 50 individuals each. One group (monosex) was fed a diet treated with methyl-testosterone to induce sex reversal while the other group (mixed sex) was reared on a control diet. After hapa rearing, tagging and weighing, fish were randomly divided and stocked in six earthen ponds, three for mixed sex and three for monosex fish. After 5months, fish were harvested, photographed and weighed. Genetic parameter estimates for HW, DGC, and shape were obtained on 2105 fish. Heritability estimates for HW, DGC and shape were 0.21±0.03, 0.26±0.04 and 0.12±0.03 for mixed sex respectively. Genetic correlations for HW between monosex and mixed sex was 0.74±0.14, suggesting low G×E. The corresponding rg for DGC and shape were lower; 0.59±0.10, and −0.19±0.11, respectively, denoting the presence of G×E. It is concluded that G×E between the mixed sex nucleus and monosex production fish is important, and that a breeding programme for Nile tilapia needs to include production performance from monosex siblings. STATEMENT OF RELEVANCE First study that reports estimates for Genotype by treatment interaction between hormone treated monosex Nile tilapia and mixed sex Nile tilapia, and discusses the consequences for nucleus breeding programmes.},

Shading greenhouse may be an effective method to achieve a suitable environment for crop growth and to enhance crop yield and quality in places or seasons where there is high light intensity. Therefore, solar radiation levels may modify the biomass accumulation and bromatological composition. Different solar radiation levels (100{\%}, 70{\%} and 50{\%} of available solar radiation) were simulated in order to determine crop responses to these factors in chicory (Cichorium intybus L. var. foliosum). A hydroponic experiment was conducted in an experimental greenhouse in the city of Frederico Westphalen, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Plants grown in lower solar radiation levels are more efficient in converting solar radiation into dry matter, had a higher lipid content, increased chlorophyll indices a, b and total, as well as reduced leaf thickness, acid detergent fiber, cellulose, and lignin content, presenting more attractive bromatological features for commercial production. In this study it was demonstrated that the use of shading screens is an effective method to attenuate the solar radiation, this is especially relevant in places or seasons where there is high light intensity, which contribute to achieve better characteristics of the chicory produced.},

In the 2016 harvest, two experiments were carried out in the state of Pernambuco, Brazil: one for the carioca group, with 20 genotypes, in the municipalities of Caruaru, Arcoverde, and Bel{\'{e}}m de S{\~{a}}o Francisco; and the other for the black group, with 12 genotypes, in the municipalities of Caruaru and Arcoverde. The parameters were estimated by mixed models, and selection was performed by the harmonic mean of the relative performance of genetic values, using three strategies: selection based on the predicted genetic value, without interaction; selection based on the predicted genetic value, considering each location; and simultaneous selection for grain yield, stability, and adaptability. The environments affected the phenotypic expression of the carioca bean genotypes, indicating specific adaptation. The average heritability for grain yield showed high values for black bean genotypes, which is a favorable condition for selection, and low values for carioca bean genotypes. The black bean genotypes CNFP 15684, 'BRS Esteio', CNFP 15678, CNFP 15697, CNFP 15695, and 'IPR Uirapuru' show the best performances in the studied environments, simultaneously considering grain yield, adaptability, and stability.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The most important aspect of any classifier is its error rate, because this quantifies its predictive capacity. Thus, the accuracy of error estimation is critical. Error estimation is problematic in small-sample classifier design because the error must be estimated using the same data from which the classifier has been designed. Use of prior knowledge, in the form of a prior distribution on an uncertainty class of feature-label distributions to which the true, but unknown, feature-distribution belongs, can facilitate accurate error estimation (in the mean-square sense) in circumstances where accurate completely model-free error estimation is impossible. This paper provides analytic asymptotically exact finite-sample approximations for various performance metrics of the resulting Bayesian Minimum Mean-Square-Error (MMSE) error estimator in the case of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) in the multivariate Gaussian model. These performance metrics include the first, second, and cross moments of the Bayesian MMSE error estimator with the true error of LDA, and therefore, the root-mean-square (RMS) error of the estimator. We lay down the theoretical groundwork for Kolmogorov double-asymptotics in a Bayesian setting, which enables us to derive asymptotic expressions of the desired performance metrics. From these we produce analytic finite-sample approximations and demonstrate their accuracy via numerical examples. Various examples illustrate the behavior of these approximations and their use in determining the necessary sample size to achieve a desired RMS. The Supplementary Material contains derivations for some equations and added figures.},

abstract = {Annotation Full of biological applications, exercises, and interactive graphical examples, Foundational and Applied Statistics for Biologists Using R presents comprehensive coverage of both modern analytical methods and statistical foundations. The author harnesses the inherent properties of the R environment to enable students to examine the code of complicated procedures step by step and thus better understand the process of obtaining analysis results. The graphical capabilities of R are used to provide interactive demonstrations of simple to complex statistical concepts. Assuming only familiarity with algebra and general calculus, the text offers a flexible structure for both introductory and graduate-level biostatistics courses. The first seven chapters address fundamental topics in statistics, such as the philosophy of science, probability, estimation, hypothesis testing, sampling, and experimental design. The remaining four chapters focus on applications involving correlation, regression, ANOVA, and tabular analyses. Unlike classic biometric texts, this book provides students with an understanding of the underlying statistics involved in the analysis of biological applications. In particular, it shows how a solid statistical foundation leads to the correct application of procedures, a clear understanding of analyses, and valid inferences concerning biological phenomena. Web ResourceAn R package (asbio) developed by the author is available from CRAN. Accessible to those without prior command-line interface experience, this companion library contains hundreds of functions for statistical pedagogy and biological research. The author's website also includes an overview of R for novices.},

abstract = {Increases in the terrestrial levels of ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation (280 to 320 nm) due to diminished stratospheric ozone have prompted an investigation of the protective mechanisms that contribute to UV-B tolerance in plants. In response to UV-B stress, flowering plants produce a variety of UV-absorptive secondary products derived from phenylalanine. Arabidopsis mutants with defects in the synthesis of these compounds were tested for UV-B sensitivity. The transparent testa-4 (tt4) mutant, which has reduced flavonoids and normal levels of sinapate esters, is more sensitive to UV-B than the wild type when grown under high UV-B irradiance. The tt5 and tt6 mutants, which have reduced levels of UV-absorptive leaf flavonoids and the monocyclic sinapic acid ester phenolic compounds, are highly sensitive to the damaging effects of UV-B radiation. These results demonstrate that both flavonoids and other phenolic compounds play important roles in vivo in plant UV-B protection.},

abstract = {Background and aims
The main objectives of this paper were to investigate the absorption and utilization of nitrogen applied at the panicle stage in rice for promoting and protecting spikelet and the effect of residual nitrogen on the utilization of nitrogen in the succeeding wheat crop in the rotation system.
Methods
A field experiment was combined with a mini-plot experiment with 15N labelled urea applied at the panicle stage in rice. The experiments included three nutrient management treatments: F, S1 and S2. 126 kg N ha−1, 120 kg N ha−1, 72 kg N ha−1 labeled with 30 atom{\%} excess 15N were applied in rice, respectively.
Results
(1) Compare to conventional fertilizer management (F), the optimized fertilizer management (S1{\&}S2) reduced the amount of nitrogen applications, whereas the rice and wheat yield did not decrease, and nitrogen use efficiency was improved. (2) At rice harvest, 4.7–10.7{\%} of the fertilizer 15N was found in the 0–20 cm profile. The fertilizer 15N absorbed by the wheat during the period from jointing to heading accounted for 37.0{\%}-51.1{\%} of the total 15N absorbed. (3) The sum of the ratio of nitrogen absorption from the rice panicle fertilizer applied to the crops (rice and wheat) and ratio of soil residue nitrogen in the wheat field were ordered S2 {\textgreater} S1 {\textgreater} F.
Conclusion
The optimized fertilization management reduced the loss of the rice nitrogen in the rice–wheat rotation system through improved recycling of rice panicle nitrogen applied in the crop-soil system.},

abstract = {Summary
Lettuce (Lactuca sativa) plants grown in a protective environment, similar to in vitro conditions, were acclimated in a growth chamber and subjected to water stress to examine the activation of genes involved in secondary metabolism and biosynthesis of antioxidants. The expression of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), $\gamma$-tocopherol methyl transferase ($\gamma$-TMT) and l-galactose dehydrogenase (l-GalDH) genes involved in the biosynthesis of phenolic compounds, $\alpha$-tocopherol and ascorbic acid, respectively, were determined during plant adaptation. These genes were activated in tender plants, grown under protective conditions, when exposed to normal growing conditions in a growth chamber. A large increase in transcript level for PAL, a key gene in the phenylpropanoid pathway leading to the biosynthesis of a wide array of phenolics and flavonoids, was observed within 1 h of exposure of tender plants to normal growing conditions. Plant growth, especially the roots, was retarded in tender plants when exposed to normal growing conditions. Furthermore, exposure of both protected and unprotected plants to water stress resulted in the activation of PAL. PAL inhibition by 2-aminoindan-2-phosphonic acid (AIP) rendered these plants more sensitive to chilling and heat shock treatments. These results suggest that activation of secondary metabolism as well as the antioxidative metabolism is an integral part of plant adaptation to normal growing conditions in lettuce plants.},

abstract = {Sixteen white clover genotypes and their half-sib progenies were grown in pure stand. Each clover progeny was also grown in a mixed stand that also included three grass varieties of different species. Dry matter (DM) yield was measured over 2 years and seed yield at the second year. Competitive ability of clover families was defined as the ratio between mixed stand and pure stand for clover DM yield. Narrow-sense heritability from parent-offspring regression of pure stand data was high to moderate (h20.50) for DM yield, seed yield and most of their components. Persistence as predicted by stolon density showed negative genetic correlations with seed yield (rg= -0.70) and DM yield (r2= -0.60), whereas seed yield and DM yield tended towards a negative correlation (r2=0.45). Sizes of different vegetative or reproductive organs were generally correlated positively. Evidence was provided that the set of parent genotypes represents well the genetic variation available within the Ladino gene pool. The results highlighted the difficulty of combining relatively short-term DM yield, persistence and seed yield into a unique plant type. Differences in competitive ability emerged only in the second year, better ability being related mainly to petiole length among the traits assessed in pure stand.},

In the current study a set of four maize populations, i.e. PSEV-3-2ES, Pop 2004-BS, Pop 2006 and Jalal 2003 were evaluated for genetic potential and variability. Breeding material was evaluated in randomized complete block design with three replications. Analysis of variance results showed highly significant differences (P≤ 0.01) for all the traits. The highest values for plant height (169.1 cm), ear height (75.13 cm), leaves plant-1 (11.33), flag leaf area (106.5 cm2), grain rows ear-1 (13.67) and grain yield (5927 kg ha-1) were recorded for Jalal-2003. Broad sense heritability (h2bs) ranged from 0.29 to 0.95 for various traits. Among the tested populations Jalal-2003 proved to be superior for most of the traits studied.

That anthocyanins may protect leaves in plants facing biotic or abiotic stressors, an idea dating back to Pringsheim (1879), is arguably the most widely accepted function for foliar anthocyanins, although the mechanism(s) by which they could mitigate effects of stress remains heatedly debated. In addition to the most frequently discussed putative roles of anthocyanins as antioxidants and sunscreens, other less-explored possibilities might equally serve to ameliorate plant function under, for example, under conditions of mineral imbalance. In particular: (i) anthocyanins may serve as metal-chelating agents under conditions of excess edaphic metal ions and (ii) anthocyanin accumulation might delay foliar senescence, which is otherwise usually accelerated in plants growing under macronutrient deficiency. The latter mechanism might be particularly advantageous to prolong plant survival and increase the possibility of reproductive success.},

In this context, the assessment of seedling development, including the analysis of the seed reserves mobilization are a reliable method to investigate the physiological potential of seed lots. In this preliminary study, the aim was to investigate the dynamics of seed reserves mobilization of a sample of soybean commercial cultivars. By means of the seedling length bioassay and weight of dry matter of seeds, cotyledons, hypocotyls and radicles, information on the reserves mobilization during the germination process was obtained. Data were subjected to analysis of variance and Scott and Knott test, and afterwards, phenotypic correlations between traits were obtained. The results have shown that the dry matter of seeds, reserves reduction of seeds and dry matter of seedlings are positively correlated, and thus, seeds containing more reserves may be more effective during the early development of seedlings. In contrast, reserve reduction of seeds and conversion efficiency of the seeds reserves in the dry matter of seedlings are negatively correlated.Key words: Glycine max (L.)

abstract = {The precompression stress value defines the transition from the reloading curve to the virgin compression line in the stress–strain curve, which can be used to quantify the highest load or the most intense predrying previously applied to the soil. Thus, in soils with well-defined structured soil horizons, each layer can be characterized by such mechanical strength. Penetration resistance measurements, on the other hand, can be used to determine total soil strength profiles in the field. The effect of long-term tillage systems on physical and mechanical properties was determined in undisturbed and remolded samples collected at 5 and 15 cm depth, 6 months after applying no-till (NT), chisel plow (CP), and conventional tillage (CT) treatments, along with the application of mineral fertilizer and poultry litter. The compressibility tests were performed under confined conditions, with normal loads varying from 10 to 400 kPa after a defined predrying to −6 or −30 kPa. Penetration resistance was determined in the field, after seeding, in three positions: seeding row (SR), untrafficked interrow (UI), and recently trafficked interrow (TI). No-till system showed greater soil resistance to deformation than tilled treatments, as determined by the higher precompression stress and lower coefficient of compressibility. When original soil structure was destroyed (remolded samples), smaller differences were found. The application of extra organic matter (poultry litter) resulted in a reduction of precompression stress in undisturbed samples. Penetration resistance profiles showed greater differences among tillage treatments in the upper layer of the untrafficked interrow, where NT system showed the higher values. Smaller differences were found in the seeding row (with lower values) and in recently trafficked interrow (with higher values), showing that even traffic with a light tractor after soil tillage reduced drastically the effect of previous tillage by loosening up the soil. On the other hand, the tool used to cut the soil and to open the furrow for seeding, incorporated in the direct seeding machine, was sufficient to realleviate surface soil compaction.},

abstract = {SYNOPSIS The effect of environment on growth-stress splitting, wood density, fibre length, shrinkage and heartwood content was studied using 31 five-year-old eucalypt clones, mostly Eucalyptus grandis and E. grandis-based hybrids, grown in replicated trials at 26 sites. An analysis of variance was carried out for each wood property to test the interaction between site and clone. For each clone a linear regression of the individual property value on the mean of all clones for each site was computed as a further measure of clone-by-site interaction. Both analyses indicated that genotype-by-environment interaction does exist for some clones and that it is applicable to all the wood properties considered except fibre length. However, clones showing sensitivity to changes in the environment for a particular wood property did not necessarily show sensitivity in the case of other wood properties. In other words, no clone could be singled out for showing sensitivity towards changes in the environment for all its wood properties. Although the trial was young at the time of sampling, the results indicated some important trends. Information of this kind is of fundamental importance for tree breeding programmes as it would form a useful basis for correct choice of clones if GEI of significant nature and magnitude is detected.},

abstract = {Tannins are common secondary compounds in plant material and are known for their ability to bind to protein which reduces nitrogen availability in the diet. In fruits, these compounds are responsible for their astringency which is thought to result in reduced food intake. In this study, the repellent effects of tannins were examined in three species of frugivorous birds: red-winged starlings Onychognathus morio, speckled mousebirds Colius striatus and Cape white-eyes Zosterops virens. Birds were fed artificial fruit diets containing varying levels of tannins in paired choice tests with the amount of food eaten by birds used to determine preference. Red-winged starlings were attracted to the control diet, indifferent to the medium tannin diet and deterred by the high tannin diet whereas speckled mousebirds and Cape white-eyes were not deterred at all concentrations. The discrepancy in the results was attributed to differences in taste sensitivity, tolerance levels and detoxification mechanisms of secondary compounds between species. Because fruit selection and ultimately fruit removal rates affect plant community composition, the disparity in the results suggests that frugivorous birds do not contribute equally to plant community dynamics. However, plant secondary compounds in fruits are diverse and their effects are similarly diverse and there is potential that different groups of secondary compounds generate disparate effects. Similar studies on other types of secondary compounds may thus contribute towards a broader understanding of the role of secondary compounds in mediating fruit-frugivore interactions.},

C. 2. 4. 1. 13) and sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) (UDP glucose: D-fructose-6-phosphate 2-glucosyltransferase, E. C. 2. 4. 1. 14) were determined at various stages of maturity in fruits of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. cv. Momotaro). CO2 enriched tomatoes had lower amounts of citric, malic and oxalic acids, and higher amounts of ascorbic acid, fructose, glucose and sucrose synthase activity than the control. Elevated CO2 enhanced fruit growth and colouring during development. Citric acid was the primary organic acid followed by malic and oxalic acids. The concentration of organic acids (mg g−1 fresh weight) and of ascorbic acid (mg 100g−1 fresh weight) increased with the maturity of fruits; their maximum concentrations were found at the pink stage of ripening, but declined slightly at the red stage. The amount of reducing sugars (mg g−1 fresh weight) increased with the advancement of maturity, with fructose being the predominant sugar. The decrease in SS activity was accompanied by an increase in the concentrations of reducing sugars. There were no significant differences in fruit firmness, sucrose concentration and SPS activity between the treatments. The SPS activity did not change, but remained relatively constant throughout fruit development. The results also suggest that SS levels correlated positively with sucrose concentration but negatively with the concentration of reducing sugars.},

abstract = {In Part I is given a survey of the results of a statistical examination of the yield of the plots of Broadbalk “Wheat field during 67 years. The main features of the comparison of mean yields are well known; the comparative rates of decrement, shown in Section 5, supply a class of facts well worthy of further study. Particularly striking are the relatively slow rates of decrement of plots 2b and 8, compared with plot 7, which would seem to show a permanent advantage in very high nitrogenous dressings, and to emphasise the need for caution in the application of the principle of diminishing returns. The evidence of the influence of potassium sulphate and its substitutes, sodium sulphate and magnesium sulphate, shown in Table V, is also very striking. An unsuspected feature of the changes of mean yields, which precludes the possibility of obtaining from these data true curves of exhaustion has appeared in the slow changes which have taken place in all the plots in a similar manner. In Part II the mathematical methods by which the variation has been analysed has been discussed, partly as a justification of novel procedure, partly, to make clear that the three types of variations found have been genuinely distinguished. In Part III such evidence as is available has been presented, in order to throw light upon the possibility that the changes in mean yield have been caused by variations in the prevalence of weeds at different periods. One point of importance which should be emphasised is that average wheat yields, even over long periods, from different fields or for different seasons cannot approach in accuracy the comparison of plots of the same field in the same seasons. The advantage of the method adopted by Lawes in the permanent experiments which he instituted is very evident. The effects of weather clearly require that the seasons should be identical, unless the series be very long, but the slow changes in mean yield show that even comparatively long series of different years from the same field cannot be accurately compared. Within the same field, however, the slow changes have almost proportional effects, and comparison between the mean yields of neighbouring plots may be made with great accuracy. The only case in which changes in mean yield sensibly affect the comparison of averages is that of plots 17 and 18. In comparing these with plots 3 and 4, 5, 7, and 10, it would be more accurate to confine attention to high yielding periods, at which the disturbing causes are at their minimum. It is believed that the deviations from the smooth curves, which have been freed, for the most part, from the effects of exhaustion and weeds, form statistically homogeneous material for the study of meteorological effects.},

abstract = {Oxidative stress is a condition in which the balance between the production and elimination of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is disturbed. However, plants have developed a very sophisticated mechanism to mitigate the effect of ROS by constantly adjusting the concentration thereof to acceptable levels. Electromagnetic radiation is one of the factors which results in oxidative stress. In the current study, ionizing gamma radiation generated from a Cobalt-60 source was used to induce oxidative stress in Phaseolus vulgaris seedlings. Plants were irradiated with several radiation doses, with 2 kGy found to be the optimal, non-lethal dose. Metabolite distribution patterns from irradiated and non-irradiated plants were analyzed using UHPLC-qTOF-MS and multivariate data models such as principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal projection to latent structures discriminate analysis (OPLS-DA). Metabolites such as hydroxycinnamic phenolic acids, flavonoids, terpenes, and a novel chalcone were found to be perturbed in P. vulgaris seedlings treated with the aforementioned conditions. The results suggest that there is a compensatory link between constitutive protectants and inducible responses to injury as well as defense against oxidative stress induced by ionizing radiation. The current study is also the first to illustrate the power of a metabolomics approach to decipher the effect of gamma radiation on crop plants.},

Thirty wheat genotypes were grown in seven environments in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, during one crop season. In each environment, a randomized complete block design with three replicates was used. The PIV was elaborated from the following traits: first germination count, germination percentage, accelerated aging, and electrical conductivity. The evaluated phenotypic index makes it possible to define macroenvironments for the production of wheat seeds with high physiological potential and to understand the implications of the genotype x environment interaction. The phenotypic index of seed vigor is effective to rank genotypes considering multi-trait selection related to the vigor of wheat seeds produced in Southern Brazil.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The effects of NO-3 and NH+4 nutrition on hydroponically grown wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) were assessed from measurements of growth, gas exchange and xylem sap nitrogen contents. Biomass accumulation and shoot moisture contents of wheat and maize were lower with NH+4 than with NO-3 nutrition. The shoot:root ratios of wheat plants were increased with NH+4 compared to NO-3 nutrition, while those of maize were unaffected by the nitrogen source. Differences between NO-3 and NH+4-fed plant biomasses were apparent soon after introduction of the nitrogen into the root medium of both wheat and maize, and these differences were compounded during growth.
Photosynthetic rates of 4 mM N-fed wheat were unaffected by the form of nitrogen supplied whereas those of 12 mM NH+4-fed wheat plants were reduced to 85{\%} of those 12 mM NO-3-fed wheat plants. In maize supplied with 4 and 12 mM NH+4 the photosynthetic rates were 87 and 82{\%} respectively of those of NO-3-fed plants. Reduced photosynthetic rates of NH+4 compared to NO-3-fed wheat and maize plants may thus partially explain reduced biomass accumulation in plants supplied with NH+4 compared to NO-3 nutrition. Differences in the partitioning of biomass between the shoots and roots of NO-3-and NH+4-fed plants may also, however, arise from xylem translocation of carbon from the root to the shoot in the form of amino compounds. The organic nitrogen content of xylem sap was found to be considerably higher in NH+4- than in NO-3-fed plants. This may result in depletion of root carbohydrate resources through translocation of amino compounds to the shoot in NH+4-fed wheat plants. The concentration of carbon associated with organic nitrogen in the xylem sap of maize was considerably higher than that in wheat. This may indicate that the shoot and root components of maize share a common carbon pool and thus differences induced by different forms of inorganic nitrogen are manifested as altered overall growth rather than changes in the shoot:root ratios.Copyright 1993, 1999 Academic Press},

It can be used to derive the Kalman filter, the method of Kriging used for ore reserve estimation, credibility theory used to work out insurance premiums, and Hoadley's quality measurement plan used to estimate a quality index. It can be used for removing noise from images and for small-area estimation. This paper presents the theory of BLUP, some examples of its application and its relevance to the foundations of statistics. Understanding of procedures for estimating random effects should help people to understand some complicated and controversial issues about fixed and random effects models and also help to bridge the apparent gulf between the Bayesian and Classical schools of thought.},

abstract = {Basic 7S globulin (Bg7S), which accumulates in mature soybean (Glycine max) seeds, is an extracellular matrix protein. A large amount of Bg7S is synthesized de novo and is eluted from soybean seeds when immersed in 50–60°C water (hot water treatment, HWT). However, the Bg7S elution mechanism remains unclear. Under HWT, the seeds probably undergo heat stress and flooding stress. To obtain fundamental knowledge related to how Bg7S is eluted from hot-water-treated seeds, this study compared Bg7S elution among soybean cultivars having different flooding tolerance during pre-germination. The amounts of Bg7S eluted from seeds varied significantly among cultivars. Elution was suppressed by seed coats regarded as preventing the leakage of seed contents by rapid water imbibition. Furthermore, Bg7S expression levels differed among cultivars, although the difference did not result from any variation in Bg7S promoter sequences. However, the expression levels of Bg7S under HWT were not associated with the flooding tolerance level. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that the Bg7S accumulated in the intercellular space of hot-water-treated seeds. Plasma membrane shrinkage was observed. The main proteins eluted from seeds under HWT were located in the extracellular space. This study clarified the mechanism of Bg7S elution from seeds under HWT.},

abstract = {Ecologists have long ignored or underestimated the importance of plant–herbivore interactions owing to the diversities of herbivores, plant defensive strategies and ecological systems. In this review, we briefly discussed the categories of herbivores. Then we reviewed the major types of plant defenses against herbivores. Selective forces of herbivore pressures have led to the evolution of various defensive mechanisms in plants, which can be classified into (i) resistance traits that reduce the amount of damage received, including physical, chemical, and biotic traits; (ii) tolerance mechanisms that decrease the impact of herbivore damage, and (iii) escape strategies that reduce the probability of plants to be found by herbivores. These strategies have been studied at different levels from molecular genetics and genomics, to chemistry and physiology, to community and ecosystem ecology. We summarized the development of the methodology for studying plant defenses against herbivores. Particularly, 24 of those hypotheses and models, which are influential in the international community concerning the relationship between plants and herbivores, including the defensive mimicry hypothesis, the compensatory continuum hypothesis, the slow-growth-high-mortality hypothesis, etc, were introduced and grouped into four categories according to plant defense strategies in the present review. Finally, we also reviewed the research progress of plant–herbivore interactions in China, and discussed the perspectives of studies on plant–herbivore interactions.},

abstract = {New methods that incorporate the main and interaction effects of high-dimensional markers and of high-dimensional environmental covariates gave increased prediction accuracy of grain yield in wheat across and within environments. In most agricultural crops the effects of genes on traits are modulated by environmental conditions, leading to genetic by environmental interaction (G × E). Modern genotyping technologies allow characterizing genomes in great detail and modern information systems can generate large volumes of environmental data. In principle, G × E can be accounted for using interactions between markers and environmental covariates (ECs). However, when genotypic and environmental information is high dimensional, modeling all possible interactions explicitly becomes infeasible. In this article we show how to model interactions between high-dimensional sets of markers and ECs using covariance functions. The model presented here consists of (random) reaction norm where the genetic and environmental gradients are described as linear functions of markers and of ECs, respectively. We assessed the proposed method using data from Arvalis, consisting of 139 wheat lines genotyped with 2,395 SNPs and evaluated for grain yield over 8 years and various locations within northern France. A total of 68 ECs, defined based on five phases of the phenology of the crop, were used in the analysis. Interaction terms accounted for a sizable proportion (16 {\%}) of the within-environment yield variance, and the prediction accuracy of models including interaction terms was substantially higher (17-34 {\%}) than that of models based on main effects only. Breeding for target environmental conditions has become a central priority of most breeding programs. Methods, like the one presented here, that can capitalize upon the wealth of genomic and environmental information available, will become increasingly important.},

Furthermore the extracts were chemically characterized in terms of phenolic acids and related compounds. The identified molecules (p-hydroxybenzoic, p-coumaric and cinnamic acids) and their glucuronated and methylated derivatives obtained by chemical synthesis were also evaluated for the same bioactivity, in order to establish structure–activity relationships and to comprehend the effects of in vivo metabolism reactions in the activity of the compounds. The extracts of Pleurotus ostreatus, Macrolepiota procera, Boletus impolitus and Agaricus bisporus revealed the strongest anti-inflammatory potential (EC50 values 96 ± 1 to 190 ± 6 $\mu$g/mL), and also the highest concentration of cinnamic acid (656 to 156 $\mu$g/g), which was also the individual compound with the highest anti-inflammatory activity. The derivatives of p-coumaric acid revealed the strongest properties, specially the derivative methylated in the carboxylic group (CoA-M1) that exhibited similar activity to the one showed by dexamethasone used as anti-inflammatory standard; by contrast, the derivatives of p-hydroxybenzoic revealed the lowest inhibition of NO production. All in all, whereas the conjugation reactions change the chemical structure of phenolic acids and may increase or decrease their activity, the glucuronated and methylated derivatives of the studied compounds are still displaying anti-inflammatory activity.},

Procedures using linear-bilinear models are used to find disjoint subsets of sites or genotypes with negligible crossover genotype × environment interaction. In terms of correlations, these subsets of sites or genotypes should be such that pairs of sites have nearly perfect positive genetic correlations. Perfect positive genetic correlation between sites is a sufficient, but not a necessary, condition for a non-COI pattern. The main objective of this study was to use the mixed model theory to confirm that the subsets of sites and genotypes formed by using the linear-bilinear models have negligible crossover genotype × environment interaction. If there is no significant crossover interaction in a subset of sites or genotypes, then the mixed model should be able to confirm this by nonrejection of the hypothesis that the covariance structure has perfect genetic correlation. Mixed model analysis of results from two multisite cultivar trials confirmed the validity of the procedures using linear-bilinear model methods for clustering sites and genotypes into noncrossover genotype × environment interaction subsets.},

Amorpha-4,11-diene synthase (ADS), a sesquiterpene synthase, and CYP71AV1, a P450 monooxygenase, are two key enzymes of the artemisinin biosynthesis pathway. Accumulation of artemisinin can be induced by the phytohormone jasmonate (JA). Here, we report the characterization of two JA-responsive AP2 family transcription factors—AaERF1 and AaERF2—from A. annua L. Both genes were highly expressed in inflorescences and strongly induced by JA. Yeast one-hybrid and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed that they were able to bind to the CRTDREHVCBF2 (CBF2) and RAV1AAT (RAA) motifs present in both ADS and CYP71AV1 promoters. Transient expression of either AaERF1 or AaERF2 in tobacco induced the promoter activities of ADS or CYP71AV1, and the transgenic A. annua plants overexpressing either transcription factor showed elevated transcript levels of both ADS and CYP71AV1, resulting in increased accumulation of artemisinin and artemisinic acid. By contrast, the contents of these two metabolites were reduced in the RNAi transgenic lines in which expression of AaERF1 or AaERF2 was suppressed. These results demonstrate that AaERF1 and AaERF2 are two positive regulators of artemisinin biosynthesis and are of great value in genetic engineering of artemisinin production.},

Free zeatin (Z), zeatin riboside (Z-r), and their glucoside conjugates were purified from butanol-soluble fractions by means of a cellulose phosphate exchanger and thin-layer chromatography. Hormones were analyzed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Results of these analyses indicate that changes in free and bound IAA within the stem do not correlate well with the release of tiller buds (as brought about by decapitation, gravistimulation, or the emergence of the inflorescence). However, increases in Z-r levels are well correlated with tiller release. The glucoside conjugate of Z-r may act as a storage form of cytokinin in quiescent tiller buds. In light of these results, we find that the auxin-cytokinin ratio in oat stem segments is shifted during tiller},

abstract = {The aim of this work was to use growth models as an alternative analysis of experiments with tomatoes. The data were obtained from field experiments of tomatoes carried out in the 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 growing seasons. Six and nine harvests were carried out in 2015/2016 and 2016/2017, respectively. In each harvest, the number and mass of fruits per plant were assessed. The ANOVA for repeated measures was performed to analysis of the data, and the residuals were assessed. Also for each variable, the Brody, Gompertz, Logistic and von Bertalanffy growth models were fitted as a function of the accumulated values per plant in each harvest and days after the transplant of the seedlings. The assumptions of normality, homogeneity and independence of residuals were verified by the Shapiro-Wilk, Breusch-Pagan and Durbin-Watson tests, respectively. The bias of the parameters was evaluated by the intrinsic and parametric nonlinearity, by the difference between OLS-based and the mean of 10.000 bootstrap-based parameter estimates, and by evaluating the symmetry of the sampling distributions of such parameters. Among the models tested, the one that presented a high coefficient of determination and less non-linearity was selected. The parameters of the selected model were compared by the F test. From the second-, third- and fourth-order derivatives with respect to x (days after transplant), the maximum acceleration point, inflection point, maximum deceleration point, and point of asymptotic deceleration were estimated. The residuals increased with the mean when ANOVA was used, and the data transformation did not fix the violated assumption. The violation of the model's assumptions motivated us to propose nonlinear models as an alternative to statistical analysis with ANOVAs. The logistic model had parameters close to being unbiased, and all assumptions have been meeting. Due to this, the logistic model was selected. The critical points of this model allowed assessing the productive precocity, crop concentration period and productive behavior of the genotypes during the productive period. Finally, we have shown that growth models may be an interesting alternative to standard ANOVA procedures to analyze experiments with horticultural crops in future studies.},

abstract = {The identification of genetic determinants for water-use efficiency (WUE) and their incorporation into crop plants is critical as world water resources are predicted to become less stable over the coming decades. However, quantification of WUE in small model species such as Arabidopsis is difficult because of low plant water loss relative to root zone evaporation. Furthermore, measurements of long-term WUE are labor-intensive and time-consuming. A novel high-throughput closed-container growing system for measuring plant WUE is described. The system eliminates nearly all water loss from the media and does not require irrigation throughout the duration of a typical experiment. Using the model species Arabidopsis thaliana and Eutrema salsugineum, it was confirmed that under growth chamber conditions, this system: (1) eliminates the need for irrigation for as much as 30 days with media water content remaining above 80{\%} full capacity; (2) allows for quantification of WUE in plants with a leaf area as small as ca. 20 cm2; (3) does not inhibit plant growth; and (4) does not alter media conditions outside of an acceptable range for these species. The growing system provides an efficient high-throughput system for quantifying plant water loss and WUE.},

abstract = {Effective and adapted criteria for irrigation scheduling are required to improve yield and water use efficiency (WUE) and reduce the environmental impacts associated with water and nutrients losses by runoff and leaching. In this study, field-scale experiments were conducted at four commercial strawberry production sites with contrasting soil and climatic conditions. Within each site, the influence of different soil matric potential-based irrigation thresholds (IT) on yield and WUE was evaluated. Matric potential-based irrigation management was also compared with common irrigation practices used by producers in each site's respective areas. At Site 1 (silty clay loam; humid continental (Dfb) climate), an IT of −15 kPa improved yields by 6.2{\%} without any additional use of water relative to common irrigation practices. At Site 2, with similar soil and climatic conditions, the irrigation treatments did not affect yield and the matric potential-based management decreased WUE relative to common practices. However, the results suggested that maintaining the soil matric potential lower than −9 kPa could induce stressing conditions for the plants. At Site 3 (sandy loam; Mediterranean (Cs) climate), the best yield and WUE were obtained with an IT of −8 kPa and suggested that WUE could be further improved by implementing high-frequency irrigation. At Site 4 (clay loam; Mediterranean (Cs) climate), results suggested that an IT between −10 and −15 kPa could optimize yield and WUE, and matric potential-based irrigation considerably reduced leaching under the root zone relative to common practices. Considering the results from all sites, an IT of −10 kPa appears to be adequate as a starting point for further optimizing irrigation under most field conditions.},

abstract = {The problem of identifying subtle time-space clustering of disease, as may be occurring in leukemia, is described and reviewed. Published approaches, generally associated with studies of leukemia, not dependent on knowledge of the underlying population for their validity, are directed towards identifying clustering by establishing a relationship between the temporal and the spatial separations for the n ( n - 1)/2 possible pairs which can be formed from the n observed cases of disease. Here it is proposed that statistical power can be improved by applying a reciprocal transform to these separations. While a permutational approach can give valid probability levels for any observed association, for reasons of practicability, it is suggested that the observed association be tested relative to its permutational variance. Formulas and computational procedures for doing so are given.

While the distance measures between points represent symmetric relationships subject to mathematical and geometric regularities, the variance formula developed is appropriate for arbitrary relationships. Simplified procedures are given for the case of symmetric and skew-symmetric relationships. The general procedure is indicated as being potentially useful in other situations as, for example, the study of interpersonal relationships. Viewing the procedure as a regression approach, the possibility for extending it to nonlinear and multivariate situations is suggested.

Other aspects of the problem and of the procedure developed are discussed.

Similarly, pure temporal clustering can be identified by a study of incidence rates in periods of widespread epidemics. In point of fact, many epidemics of communicable diseases are somewhat local in nature and so these do actually constitute temporal-spatial clusters. For leukemia and similar diseases in which cases seem to arise substantially at random rather than as clear-cut epidemics, it is necessary to devise sensitive and efficient procedures for detecting any nonrandom component of disease occurrence.

Various ingenious procedures which statisticians have developed for the detection of disease clustering are reviewed here. These procedures can be generalized so as to increase their statistical validity and efficiency. The technic to be given below for imparting statistical validity to the procedures already in vogue can be viewed as a generalized form of regression with possible useful application to problems arising in quite different contexts.},

Multivariate models with general covariance structure are often difficult to apply to highly unbalanced data, whereas two-stage random-effects models can be used easily. In two-stage models, the probability distributions for the response vectors of different individuals belong to a single family, but some random-effects parameters vary across individuals, with a distribution specified at the second stage. A general family of models is discussed, which includes both growth models and repeated-measures models as special cases. A unified approach to fitting these models, based on a combination of empirical Bayes and maximum likelihood estimation of model parameters and using the EM algorithm, is discussed.

abstract = {Future climatic scenarios can influence crop yield levels and induce hunger if no actions are taken. In this study, we evaluated the effect of increased temperature and CO2 concentration on soybean yield components and biomass partitioning, that ultimately determine the crops productivity. This is conducted for two soybean genotypes that differ in their canopy and life cycles. Experiments were set as follows: a) T1 - ambient temperature and 390 mumolCO2 mol-1, b) T2 - ambient air temperature +2.7 degreesC and ambient CO2, and c) T3 - ambient air temperature + 2.7 degreesC and 750 mumolCO2 mol-1. Results indicate that soybean under elevated CO2 and temperature (T3), were taller and grains weighed more than under the ambient conditions in both cultivars types. However, yield has not increased substantially due to reductions in the ratio of number of branch/plant, pods/branch and grains/branch which lead also to a lesser number of total pods and grains per plant. The increase of temperature favored the number of pods and grains on branches in the modern type cultivar, and on racemes in the old cultivar. This results in more yield in both cultivars versus plants grown in the current ambient, and higher CO2 concentration plus temperature. In both cultivars, the pods and grains partition were higher on the ontogenically oldest four branches and racemes, with decrease in the other upper ones. In addition, the biomass allocation in vegetative tissues was higher than reproductive biomass, with intensity cultivar dependent. We concluded that in future the yield could be limited by reduction of the numbers of branches and racemes in plant, and by alteration at source-sink relation, thus, indicating that changes in canopy architecture are needed to better take advantage of the increasing concentration of CO2.},

Studies on sunflower cultivar selection are important for crop expansion, contributing to better cultivar adaptation to different environments. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the linear relations among sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) morphological traits in a subtropical region with lower elevations and to identify traits that may assist in cultivar selection based on agronomic performance and path analysis. The experiment was performed during the 2017/2018 agricultural year in Santa Maria (latitude 29{\&}ordm;71{\&}prime; S, longitude 53{\&}ordm;70{\&}prime; W and 90 m altitude), southern Brazil. The experimental design was a randomized block with four replicates and eight cultivars: Syn 045, BRS 323, BRS G58, BRS G59, BRS G60, BRS G61, Multissol 02 and Catissol 03. Assessed traits were plant height, stem diameter, head diameter, thousand achenes weight, yield of achenes per head and number of achenes per head. Hereafter, associations between morphological traits and achene yield were verified by means of linear relations and path analysis. Thousand achenes weight and number of achenes per head exhibited linear relations and direct effects on achene yield in subtropical region at lower elevations. Head diameter does not present direct effect on achenes yield but it has direct effect on the number of achenes per head, indicating cause-effect relation and becoming an important alternative for indirect selection of sunflower cultivars.},

abstract = {Short- and long-term N uptake/partitioning dynamics were studied using stable isotope techniques to investigate the uncertain mechanism(s) of O3 action on plant yield and photosynthate partitioning.

Glycine max [L.] Merr.(soybean) plants were grown in 15N enriched soil within open-top chambers and exposed to one of three O3 regimes: half-ambient, ambient, or 2 × ambient. The seasonal 7 h average O3 concentrations (nl l−1) were 25, 43, and 76 nl l−1, respectively. Nitrogen fixation was estimated using the 15N isotope dilution method utilizing a non-nodulating soybean isoline as the control. Macro-kjeldahl technique was used for determining N concentration. Short-term plant responses were investigated by evaluating the following parameters: {\%} N, total N, total N fixed, total N fixed per organ dry weight, the proportion of N-fixed/soil N, and the fraction of N derived through rhizobial N-fixation on an individual organ (leaves, stems, roots, pods, and nodules) and whole plant basis at two reproductive growth stages. Long-term plant responses were investigated by characterizing the same N parameters of the mature grain.

Ozone significantly affected both short- and long-term N uptake/partitioning dynamics. Ozone exposure reduced the amount of N derived from N-fixation, but did not significantly affect total N or {\%} N for organs and whole plants. For mature grain, O3 significantly decreased seed yield and all N parameters except N-fixed/soil N, but the responses were dependent upon year.

Our results suggest that total nodule activity was affected rather than specific activity. Total N uptake was maintained despite significant decreases in {\%} N-fixed and N-fixed/soil N. We conclude that N-fixation was inhibited by reduced photosynthate translocation to nodules. The photosynthate translocated was sufficient to maintain moderate rates of soil N uptake, but not adequate to maintain high rates of N-fixation, the latter costing more energy. Thus, soybeans damaged by the exposures imposed here, relied more heavily on soil N to meet their total N requirements when photosynthate translocation was inhibited. The long-term negative effects for mature seed also indicate a significant reduction in photosynthate and total N translocated to nodules, and an increased reliance on soil N. In summation, these findings and those of our companion carbon study, support the hypothesis that the mechanism of chronic O3 action involves an inhibition of carbon translocation from leaves to other organs.},

abstract = {The objective is to study the dynamics of photosynthetic radiation reaching the soil surface in stands of Acacia mearnsii De Wild and its influence on height growth in stands. This fact gives rise to the formulation of the following hypothesis for this study: "The reduction of the incidence of light inside the stand of black wattle will cause the inflection point in its height growth when this reaches 4 to 5 m in height, i.e. when the stand is between 2 and 3 years of age". The study was conducted in stands in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, where diameters at breast height, total height and photosynthetically active radiation available at ground level were measured. The frequency tended to be more intense when the age of the stands increases. It was evident that a reduction of light incidence inside the forest occurred, caused by canopy closure. Consequently, closed canopy propitiated the competition of plants. This has affected the conditions for growth in diameter and height of this species, reason why it becomes possible to conceive the occurrence of an inflection point in the growth of these two variables, confirming the formulated hypothesis.Key words: Burr function; light intensity; probabilistic models; temporal variation},

This material was used to analyse their allelic compositionat the twelve main storage protein loci. A large genetic and biochemicaldiversity of the gluten proteins was found. Several gliadin encoding lociexhibited the highest allelic diversity whereas the lowest diversity was foundfor Glu-A1 and Glu-D3 loci encoding some high molecularweight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) and LMW-GS respectively. Thevarieties were grown in three experimental locations in France. Qualityevaluation was carried out from material harvested in each location usingseven technological tests: grain protein content (Prot), grain hardness(GH), Zeleny sedimentation test (Zel), Pelshenke test (Pel), water solublepentosans (relative viscosity: Vr ), mixograph test (giving 11 parameters)and the alveograph test (dough strength W, tenacity P , extensibility L,swelling G, ratio P/L and the elasticity index Ie). Genetic and locationeffects as well as broad-sense heritability of each of the 22 technologicalparameters were calculated. GH, corresponding to the major Ha gene, Pel,and MtxW (mixograph parameter) had the highest heritability coefficients,alveograph parameters like W, P, the relative viscosity Vr and severalmixograph parameters had medium heritability coefficients whereas Protand L had the lowest. Variance analysis (using GLM procedure) allowed theeffect of the allelic diversity of the storage proteins, on the geneticvariations of each quality parameters, to be estimated. Glu-1 and Glu-3 loci had significant additive effects in the genetic variations of manyparameters. Gliadin alleles encoded at Gli-1 and Gli-2 were alsofound to play significant effect on several quality parameters. The majorpart of the phenotypic variation of the different quality parameters like Zel,Pel, W or mixograph peak time MPT was explained with the GH and allelesencoded at Glu-1 and Glu-3. Allelic variants encoded at Glu3and Gli-2 had similar contribution to the phenotypic variations ofquality parameters and accounted for 4{\%} up to 21{\%} each.},

Phenolics are the most widespread dietary antioxidants, and among these, chlorogenic acid (CGA) accumulates to high levels in some crop plants. CGA acts as an antioxidant in plants and protects against degenerative, age-related diseases in animals when supplied in their diet. cDNA clones encoding the enzyme that synthesizes CGA, hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA quinate: hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (HQT), were characterized from tomato and tobacco. Gene silencing proved HQT to be the principal route for accumulation of CGA in solanaceous species. Overexpression of HQT in tomato caused plants to accumulate higher levels of CGA, with no side-effects on the levels of other soluble phenolics, and to show improved antioxidant capacity and resistance to infection by a bacterial pathogen. Tomatoes with elevated CGA levels could be used in foods with specific benefits for human health.},

abstract = {Vegetables represent a major source of phenolic acids, powerful antioxidants characterized by an organic carboxylic acid function and which present multiple properties beneficial for human health. In consequence, developing new varieties with enhanced content in phenolic acids is an increasingly important breeding objective. Major phenolic acids present in vegetables are derivatives of cinnamic acid and to a lesser extent of benzoic acid. A large diversity in phenolic acids content has been found among cultivars and wild relatives of many vegetable crops. Identification of sources of variation for phenolic acids content can be accomplished by screening germplasm collections, but also through morphological characteristics and origin, as well as by evaluating mutations in key genes. Gene action estimates together with relatively high values for heritability indicate that selection for enhanced phenolic acids content will be efficient. Modern genomics and biotechnological strategies, such as QTL detection, candidate genes approaches and genetic transformation, are powerful tools for identification of genomic regions and genes with a key role in accumulation of phenolic acids in vegetables. However, genetically increasing the content in phenolic acids may also affect other traits important for the success of a variety. We anticipate that the combination of conventional and modern strategies will facilitate the development of a new generation of vegetable varieties with enhanced content in phenolic acids.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) is a widely used reliability index in test-retest, intrarater, and interrater reliability analyses. This article introduces the basic concept of ICC in the content of reliability analysis. DISCUSSION FOR RESEARCHERS There are 10 forms of ICCs. Because each form involves distinct assumptions in their calculation and will lead to different interpretations, researchers should explicitly specify the ICC form they used in their calculation. A thorough review of the research design is needed in selecting the appropriate form of ICC to evaluate reliability. The best practice of reporting ICC should include software information, "model," "type," and "definition" selections. DISCUSSION FOR READERS When coming across an article that includes ICC, readers should first check whether information about the ICC form has been reported and if an appropriate ICC form was used. Based on the 95{\%} confident interval of the ICC estimate, values less than 0.5, between 0.5 and 0.75, between 0.75 and 0.9, and greater than 0.90 are indicative of poor, moderate, good, and excellent reliability, respectively. CONCLUSION This article provides a practical guideline for clinical researchers to choose the correct form of ICC and suggests the best practice of reporting ICC parameters in scientific publications. This article also gives readers an appreciation for what to look for when coming across ICC while reading an article.},

Data from two uniformity trials each crop were used. For statistical analysis, the total of productivity by plant was used, considering the plants arranged in parallel crop rows the lateral openings of the greenhouse and the same plants arranged in columns perpendicular to these openings. Different scenarios were designed by excluding rows and columns to generate the borders in different plot sizes. For each scenario, a variance homogeneity test was performed among the remaining rows and columns and the variance and coefficient of variation were calculated. There is variability among rows and columns in trials with C. pepo and C. annuum in greenhouses and the use of borders does not bring benefits in terms of reduction of the coefficient of variation or reduction of cases of variances heterogeneity among rows or columns. The use of a plot size greater than or equal to or two plants for trials with C. pepo and ten plants for trials with C. annuum provides homogeneity of variances among rows and columns enabling the use of the completely randomized design.},

abstract = {In a context where agricultural practices in Europe are likely to go toward extensive systems with lower inputs, it is important to determine the genetic improvement of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) not only in high-input agricultural systems but also in low-input systems. This study assesses the improvement in agronomic traits of winter wheat cultivars cultivated in France during the second half of the 20th century at four agronomic treatments: two levels of fungicide were combined with two levels of nitrogen fertilizer. Fourteen cultivars introduced between 1946 and 1992 were grown for two years (1994 and 1995) at five locations. Selection played a major role in the increase in winter wheat yield after 1946. The contribution of selection to this increase depended on the agronomic treatment and varied from one third to one half. Reduction of height was the most important factor. New cultivars with shorter straw expressed higher harvest index values and more consistent higher yields since they were less susceptible to lodging. The ability to produce more kernels from a given total above-ground biomass was the second factor. The number of kernels per unit area had increased over time without alteration of the weight of the kernels. The negative relationship between 1000-kernel weight and kernel number/[m.sup.2] was therefore shifted and new cultivars were thus able to fill more kernels than older entries. Modern cultivars used N more efficiently than their predecessors. The future challenge will be to obtain, in low-input systems, the same genetic gains as in high-input systems.},

In leaves inoculated with C. kikuchii or D. phaseolorum, 14/15 or 8/15 defense-related genes were significantly upregulated, respectively, including the notably strong upregulation of PR3 (chitinase 1) and PR10 (ribonuclease-like protein) by both pathogens. In leaves, the pathogen concentrations declined during the 48 hpi period. In seeds inoculated with either C. kikuchii or D. phaseolorum, 7/15 or 6/15 genes were significantly upregulated, but PR3 and PPO (polyphenol oxidase) were not significantly upregulated or not detected with either pathogen treatment, while PR10 was significantly upregulated only in seeds inoculated with D. phaseolorum. Pathogen concentrations in seeds did not decline, but increased over the 48 hpi period. Our results suggest that differences between the numbers and types of defense genes upregulated in the two inoculated tissues may explain, at least partially, the decline in leaves and the increase in seeds of the pathogen quantities.},

Annual photosynthetic carbon fixation estimated with a process based model, BIOMASS, was a better climatic index than annual rainfall. Incorporation of the growth index derived from BIOMASS into the time function in the Schumacher equation led to path invariant models which improved the fit compared to the basic equation by 13, 22 and 31{\%} for mean tree height, stand basal area and stand volume respectively. Inclusion of the growth index into the asymptote function improved the fit for basal area and volume to 33 and 35{\%} respectively but these models can only be fitted when annual growth data are available and growth estimates are restricted to annual time steps. The new models improve the descriptive power of the Schumacher model and open the avenues for wider interpretation of experimental results. The models should also prove useful for updating forest inventories.},

abstract = {This work evaluated the effect of genotype by environment interaction in Andean common bean lines with white grains, in Central Southern Brazil, to identify lines with high agronomic performance, stability and adaptability, aiming to meet domestic demand and to increase the Brazilian participation in the foreign market of common bean. Nineteen trials with twelve Andean lines were conducted in 2007, 2008 and 2009, in Central Southern Brazil. Grain yield and other agronomic traits were evaluated. Data were subjected to analysis of variance and of adaptability/stability using Annicchiarico and modified AMMI methods. Significant differences were found between lines for all traits evaluated. Genotype by environment interaction was important for lines with Andean origin and white seed. The utilization of weighted mean of absolute scores and yield with the AMMI results enabled the identification of the most stable and adapted lines. Lines Poroto Alubia, CNFB 16211, Ouro Branco and WAF 160 were stable and adapted, using both methods. CNFB 16211 line presented high agronomic performance, stability and adaptability and therefore this line may be a new cultivar. USWA 70 and WAF 75 lines presented grain size similar to that required by the foreign market and superior to the Brazilian cultivars, besides favorable agronomic traits, and thus these lines may be indicated as new cultivars.},

abstract = {A long period of silk viability is critical for a good seed setting rate in maize (Zea mays L.), especially for inbred lines and hybrids with a long interval between anthesis and silking. To explore the molecular mechanism of silk viability and its heterosis, three inbred lines with different silk viability characteristics (Xun928, Lx9801, and Zong3) and their two hybrids (Xun928×Zong3 and Lx9801×Zong3) were analyzed at different developmental stages by a proteomic method. The differentially accumulated proteins were identified by mass spectrometry and classified into metabolism, protein biosynthesis and folding, signal transduction and hormone homeostasis, stress and defense responses, and cellular processes. Proteins involved in nutrient (methionine) and energy (ATP) supply, which support the pollen tube growth in the silk, were important for silk viability and its heterosis. The additive and dominant effects at a single locus, as well as complex epistatic interactions at two or more loci in metabolic pathways, were the primary contributors for mid-parent heterosis of silk viability. Additionally, the proteins involved in the metabolism of anthocyanins, which indirectly negatively regulate local hormone accumulation, were also important for the mid-parent heterosis of silk viability. These results also might imply the developmental dependence of heterosis, because many of the differentially accumulated proteins made distinct contributions to the heterosis of silk viability at specific developmental stages.},

@article{mitchell_bayesian_1988-1,
abstract = {This article is concerned with the selection of subsets of predictor variables in a linear regression model for the prediction of a dependent variable. It is based on a Bayesian approach, intended to be as objective as possible. A probability distribution is first assigned to the dependent variable through the specification of a family of prior distributions for the unknown parameters in the regression model. The method is not fully Bayesian, however, because the ultimate choice of prior distribution from this family is affected by the data. It is assumed that the predictors represent distinct observables; the corresponding regression coefficients are assigned independent prior distributions. For each regression coefficient subject to deletion from the model, the prior distribution is a mixture of a point mass at 0 and a diffuse uniform distribution elsewhere, that is, a “spike and slab” distribution. The random error component is assigned a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation $\sigma$, where ln($\sigma$) has a locally uniform noninformative prior distribution. The appropriate posterior probabilities are derived for each submodel. If the regression coefficients have identical priors, the posterior distribution depends only on the data and the parameter $\gamma$, which is the height of the spike divided by the height of the slab for the common prior distribution. This parameter is not assigned a probability distribution; instead, it is considered a parameter that indexes the members of a class of Bayesian methods. Graphical methods are proposed as informal guides for choosing $\gamma$, assessing the complexity of the response function and the strength of the individual predictor variables, and assessing the degree of uncertainty about the best submodel. The following plots against $\gamma$ are suggested: (a) posterior probability that a particular regression coefficient is 0; (b) posterior expected number of terms in the model; (c) posterior entropy of the submodel distribution; (d) posterior predictive error; and (e) posterior probability of goodness of fit. Plots (d) and (e) are suggested as ways to choose y. The predictive error is determined using a Bayesian cross-validation approach that generates a predictive density for each observation, given all of the data except that observation, that is, a type of “leave one out” approach. The goodness-of-fit measure is the sum of the posterior probabilities of all submodels that pass a standard F test for goodness of fit relative to the full model, at a specified level of significance. The dependence of the results on the scaling of the variables is discussed, and some ways to choose the scaling constants are suggested. Examples based on a large data set arising from an energy-conservation study are given to demonstrate the application of the methods.},

abstract = {The plot size estimation is based on uniformity trials, however little is known about and how the size of uniformity trial affects the estimate of the plot size. That way, the aim of this study was to determine the influence of uniformity trial size on the estimation of plot size in the eggplant crop. Two uniformity trials were performed with the eggplant culture in a plastic tunnel. The fresh mass of fruit and number of fruits were assessed in six harvests, with a seven-day interval between harvests. For each trial (Tunnel 1 and 2), 25 uniformity trials of different sizes were simulated (3, 4, 5, {\&}hellip; 28 BEU) per harvest and harvest row (individual and grouped) since they presented heteroscedasticity. For each planned uniformity trial, bootstrap procedure was used to estimate 3,000 plot sizes by the maximum coefficient of variation curvature method. The mean and 95{\%} confidence interval width was calculated by the difference between the 97.5th and 2.5th percentiles. The AIC95{\%} and plot size averages were higher in individual harvests than grouped harvests. As the size of the simulated uniformity trial increased, it was verified a reduction of the AIC95{\%} of the plot size. However, the mean plot size did not change with increasing uniformity trial size. In this way, it is possible to state that the size of the uniformity trial affects accuracy the plot size estimation because trials with few numbers of basic experimental units present high experimental variability and inaccurate estimates.},

Three different proteins with different molecular weights and isoelectric points were employed and different pHs, dendrimer concentrations and generations were tested. Variations in fluorescence intensity and emission wavelength were used as protein-dendrimer interaction probes. Interaction between dendrimers and proteins greatly depended on the protein itself and pH. Other important issues were the dendrimer concentration and generation. Protein-dendrimer interactions were favored under acidic working conditions when proteins were positively charged. Moreover, in general, high dendrimer generations promoted these interactions.

A case study of Xiamen Island, China was employed to reveal the direct and indirect effects of demographic/socioeconomic factors on solid waste generation at the urban household scale. Based on a face-to-face questionnaire and two-stage survey of solid waste generation, a path analysis model was built. Results showed that the proposed path model exhibited good fit indices. Family size and dinning-at-home rate (DR), whose coefficients were −0.40 and 0.43, respectively, were the two major factors influencing HSW directly. Moreover, family size, education level, employment rate and age structure played different degrees of indirect effects on HSW generation through respective paths, which should not be ignored. In terms of total effects, coefficients of family size, DR and employment rate were −0.46, 0.43 and −0.37, respectively, which were three most dominant factors influencing HSW generation. As for waste composition, organic waste was the most representative of HSW dynamics, and was the most sensitive to impact by the factors studied. Quantitative results of this study have important policy implications for sustainable municipal solid waste management.},

Mathematical development of growth curve models has a long history since its birth. We propose a mathematical model to describe the evolution of relative growth rate as a function of time based on a real life experiment on a major Indian Carp Cirrhinus mrigala. We establish that the proposed model is able to describe the fish growth dynamics more accurately for our experimental data than some existing models e.g. logistic, Gompertz, exponential. Approximate expressions of the points of inflection and the time of achieving the maximum relative growth rate are derived. We study, in detail, the existence of a nonlinear least squares estimator of the model parameters and their consistency properties. Test-statistics is developed to study the equality of points of inflection and equality of the amount of time necessary to achieve the maximum relative growth rate for a species at two different locations. Using the theory of variance stabilizing transformations, we propose a new test statistic to test the effect of the decay parameter for the proposed growth law. The testing procedure is found to be more sensitive in comparison with the test based on nonlinear least squares estimates. Our proposed model provides a general framework to model growth in other disciplines as well.},

abstract = {Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merrill) exposure to long days during the post-flowering phase increases total biomass, nodes, pods and seeds per plant, and also the post-flowering duration, increasing the radiation offer. This work aims to identify the main mechanisms responsible for yield increases in response to long days, separating direct photoperiodic effects on yield determination, from the indirect effect associated with changes in cumulative radiation when the crop cycle is modified by photoperiod. Two field experiments were conducted with an indeterminate soybean cultivar. A factorial combination of two radiation levels (unshaded and shaded), and two or three photoperiod regimes (control, extended 1.5 and 3 h) was imposed from flowering to maturity. Yield tended to be reduced by shade and increased by extended photoperiod mainly through their effects on nodes per m2, and thereby affecting pods and seeds per m2. Photoperiod extension increased node number due to both increased cumulative radiation (indirect effect) and delayed reproductive development (direct effect). As a result, more pods were established per unit of cumulative radiation under extended photoperiod. The results suggest that photoperiod extension enhanced yield radiation use efficiency due to the alleviation of intra-nodal interferences. The direct post-flowering photoperiodic effect on node number and the resultant effects on pod and seed number, provide evidence of direct photoperiodic effects on soybean yield determination.},

Here we report on the genetic control of grain protein content, flour water absorption, dough and bread making quality in wheat grown in three experiments under differing environmental conditions. The research used a recombinant inbred line mapping population derived from a cross between two Australian cultivars, Drysdale and Gladius. Three field experiments were conducted, including one that was sown late in order to expose the lines to high temperatures during grain filling and one in a year in which conditions were unusually cool and wet. Genomic regions containing photoperiod sensitivity loci affected grain protein content while the Ha (puroindoline) locus on chromosome 5D was associated with loaf quality traits. Other QTLs (on chromosomes 2B, 3B and 5A) were novel and not associated with any known quality or phenology genes.},

And cultivars Frontana, CD 1440 and ORS Vintecinco presented the best tolerances pre-harvest sprouting. Grain yield showed high and positive phenotypic and genotypic correlations with number of ears per square meter. Furthermore, high positive direct effect of pre-harvest sprouting on grain yield, revels lower tolerance for cultivars with high grain yield.

Germination, GSI (Germination Speed Index), electrical conductivity tests and the first count of seeds were conducted. The application of Mn did not affect the physiological quality of RR soy in postharvest. However, in post-storage, higher doses of Mn had a negative effect on tests of abnormal seedlings, GSI and electrical conductivity. The applications of Mn, regardless of the developmental stage, did not interfere in the germination and first count tests, with and without storage.

abstract = {During germination of cereal grain, $\alpha$-amylase formation is known to be inhibited by abscisic acid (ABA) and stimulated by gibberellins (GA). The role of these hormones in pre-maturity $\alpha$-amylase (PMA) formation in wheat grains is less well understood. Our previous work with ABA and GA exogenously applied to grains demonstrated a clear stimulatory effect of GA, with little effect of ABA. Here, in glasshouse experiments, fluridone (ABA biosynthesis inhibitor; FD [20 $\mu$M]) or paclobutrazol (GA biosynthesis inhibitor; PB [20 $\mu$M]) were applied to intact, developing grains of the PMA-susceptible variety Rialto at 480 days after anthesis (DAA) to assess if a reduction in endogenous ABA and/or GA alters PMA formation. The experiments were conducted under non-PMA-inducing (ambient) and PMA-inducing (cold-shock) conditions. In solvent-only treated grains, a cold-shock significantly reduced the ABA content but increased GA and $\alpha$-amylase activity. FD increased GA levels and $\alpha$-amylase activity under ambient conditions, but decreased GA levels and $\alpha$-amylase activity under cold-shock conditions, with no effect on ABA levels under either condition. PB had no effect under ambient conditions, but reduced GA levels and $\alpha$-amylase under cold-shock conditions. These results indicate an association between GA levels at mid-grain development and PMA formation in wheat.},

A total of 4, 051 features were detected and 44 metabolites were identified to be changed significantly in Populus upon infection. The identified responsive metabolites include saccharides, alcohols, organic acids, and amino acids and some secondary metabolites and most of the metabolites were detected at increased levels. Responsive metabolites were investigated about their metabolism pathway and the corresponding metabolic networks were further constructed. To our knowledge, this is the first study to identify the metabolite profiles of Populus in response to pathogen stress. The results extend our understanding of the mechanisms involved in the defense of Populus against pathogens and provide a basis for further research on plant defenses.},

abstract = {There is a lot of uncertainty in the amount and spatial variations of above-ground biomass in Africa, partly because very few allometric equations are available. The aim of this study was to assess the validity of using pan-tropical multispecies allometric equations developed by Chave et al. (2005) for estimating the above-ground biomass of trees in Central Africa and/or to develop site-specific equations. The study was conducted in lowland tropical forests of South-eastern Cameroon, at the edge between evergreen and semi-evergreen forests. Data of above-ground woody biomass were obtained from destructive sampling of 138 trees belonging to 47 taxa across a huge range of diameter (5.30–192.50 cm) and wood specific gravity (0.284–1.152 g cm−3). A set of local site-specific multi- and single-species models relating above-ground biomass to tree diameter and wood specific gravity were fitted to the data. The best model was selected using information criterion. Both tree diameter and wood specific gravity were important predictor to consider for the estimation of above-ground biomass at tree scale. Single-species models were not necessarily better than multi-species models including wood specific gravity as a predictor. The best local multi-species model had the same structure and parameters as the pan-tropical equation developed by Chave et al. (2005) for moist forests. The estimates from the pan-tropical multi-species equation were nearly as good as those of the local multi-species equation. Using wood specific gravity from the global data base only slightly increased the estimation errors, because for the study taxa wood specific gravity was highly correlated to wood specific gravity from the global data base. In this study, we showed that the pantropical multi-species allometric equation developped for moist forests can be used to produce accurate estimates of biomass and carbon stocks from diameter measurement in forest inventory and wood specific gravity from global data base at species level. These findings are especially timely given the urgent need to quantify biomass and carbon stocks in the tropics, and given the spatial extent of moist forests in Central Africa.},

abstract = {Modeling crop gross primary production (GPP) is critical to understanding the carbon dynamics of agro-ecosystems. Satellite-based studies have widely used production efficiency models (PEM) to estimate cropland GPP, wherein light use efficiency (LUE) is a key model parameter. One factor that has not been well considered in many PEMs is that canopy LUE could vary with illumination conditions. This study investigates how the partitioning of diffuse and direct solar radiation influences cropland GPP using both flux tower and satellite data. The field-measured hourly LUE under cloudy conditions was 1.50 and 1.70 times higher than that under near clear-sky conditions for irrigated corn and soybean, respectively. We applied a two-leaf model to simulate the canopy radiative transfer process, where modeled photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) absorbed by canopy agreed with tower measurements (R2 = 0.959 and 0.914 for corn and soybean, respectively). Derived canopy LUE became similar after accounting for the impact of light saturation on leaf photosynthetic capacity under varied illumination conditions. The impacts of solar radiation partitioning on satellite-based modeling of crop GPP was examined using vegetation indices (VI) derived from MODIS data. Consistent with the field modeling results, the relationship between daily GPP and PAR × VI under varied illumination conditions showed different patterns in terms of regression slope and intercept. We proposed a function to correct the influences of direct and diffuse radiation partitioning and the explained variance of flux tower GPP increased in all experiments. Our results suggest that the non-linear response of leaf photosynthesis to light absorption contributes to higher canopy LUE on cloudy days than on clear days. We conclude that accounting for the impacts of solar radiation partitioning is necessary for modeling crop GPP on a daily or shorter basis.},

The promise of plants to serve as the green factories of the future is ever increasing. Plants have been used traditionally for construction, energy, food and feed. Bioactive compounds primarily derived from specialized plant metabolism continue to serve as important scaffold molecules for pharmaceutical drug production. Yet, the past few years have witnessed a growing interest on plants as the ultimate harvesters of carbon and energy from the sun, providing carbohydrate and lipid biofuels that would contribute to balancing atmospheric carbon. How can the metabolic output from plants be increased even further, and what are the bottlenecks? Here, we present what we perceive to be the main opportunities and challenges associated with increasing the efficiency of plants as chemical factories. We offer some perspectives on when it makes sense to use plants as production systems because the amount of biomass needed makes any other system unfeasible. However, there are other instances in which plants serve as great sources of biological catalysts, yet are not necessarily the best-suited systems for production. We also present emerging opportunities for manipulating plant genomes to make plant synthetic biology a reality.},

@article{muller_cytokinin_2015,
abstract = {Auxin produced by an active primary shoot apex is transported down the main stem and inhibits the growth of the axillary buds below it, contributing to apical dominance. Here we use Arabidopsis thaliana cytokinin (CK) biosynthetic and signalling mutants to probe the role of CK in this process. It is well established that bud outgrowth is promoted by CK, and that CK synthesis is inhibited by auxin, leading to the hypothesis that release from apical dominance relies on an increased supply of CK to buds. Our data confirm that decapitation induces the expression of at least one ISOPENTENYLTRANSFERASE (IPT) CK biosynthetic gene in the stem. We further show that transcript abundance of a clade of the CK-responsive type-A Arabidopsis response regulator (ARR) genes increases in buds following CK supply, and that, contrary to their typical action as inhibitors of CK signalling, these genes are required for CK-mediated bud activation. However, analysis of the relevant arr and ipt multiple mutants demonstrates that defects in bud CK response do not affect auxin-mediated bud inhibition, and increased IPT transcript levels are not needed for bud release following decapitation. Instead, our data suggest that CK acts to overcome auxin-mediated bud inhibition, allowing buds to escape apical dominance under favourable conditions, such as high nitrate availability.},

With increasing trend towards the development of hybrids in the tropics there is a need to understand the genetics of these traits in inbred–hybrid breeding systems. The objectives of this study were to estimate the general combining abilities for secondary traits and their relationship with GY in a group of tropical white inbred lines and their hybrids under stress and non-stress environments. Traits were measured in inbred lines and their hybrid combinations across stress and non-stress subtropical and tropical environments in M{\'{e}}xico. Hybrids showed earlier flowering, taller plants, more ears per plant (EPP), higher shelling percentage, slower leaf senescence, and higher leaf chlorophyll content than inbreds under all environments. La Posta Sequı́a (LP)-derived inbreds in general had desirable GCA for traits such as anthesis–silking interval (ASI), EPP, and leaf senescence but were more susceptible to foliar diseases. Conventionally bred maize lines had better standability, stay green, and resistance to diseases. Higher GY in lines and hybrids was associated with shorter ASI, earlier flowering, increased plant and ear height, increased EPP, increased shelling percentage, delayed senescence, and greater leaf chlorophyll concentrations. Under stress vs. non-stress conditions, we observed a higher variability for ASI and EPP, a higher inbred–hybrid correlation, and significant correlations between these traits and GY. Inbreds from LP appear to have high frequency of favorable dominant alleles for ASI and EPP.},

The maize ideotype that should produce optimally when grown in such an environment would be characterized by: a) stiff, vertically-oriented leaves above the ear (leaves below the ear should be horizontally oriented); b) maximum photosynthetic efficiency; c) efficient conversion of photosynthate to grain; d) short interval between pollen shed and silkemergence; e) ear-shoot prolificacy; f) small tassel size; g) photoperiod insensitivity; h) cold-tolerance in germinating seeds and young seedlings (for genotypes grown in areas where early-planting would require planting in cold, wet soils); i) as long a grain-filling period as practically possible; and j) slow leaf senescence.},

@article{kim_instability_2015,
abstract = {It is well known that any statistic based on sample averages can be sensitive to outliers. Some examples are the conventional moments-based statistics such as the sample mean, the sample variance, or the sample covariance of a set of observations on two variables. Given that sample correlation is defined as sample covariance divided by the product of sample standard deviations, one might suspect that the impact of outliers on the correlation coefficient may be neither present nor noticeable because of a ‘dampening effect' i.e., the effects of outliers on both the numerator and the denominator of the correlation coefficient can cancel each other. In this paper, we formally investigate this issue. Contrary to such an expectation, we show analytically and by simulations that the distortion caused by outliers in the behavior of the correlation coefficient can be fairly large in some cases, especially when outliers are present in both variables at the same time. These outliers are called ‘coincidental outliers.' We consider some robust alternative measures and compare their performance in the presence of such coincidental outliers.},

@article{fracheboud_chlorophyll_1999,
abstract = {The possibility of using quenching analysis of chlorophyll a fluorescence as a selection tool for improving the cold tolerance of maize was investigated in six genotypes differing greatly in the ability to develop a competent photosynthetic apparatus at low temperature. Upon gradual cooling, measurements of the quantum yield of electron transport ($\Phi$PSII) indicated that leaves of tolerant genotypes, that developed at suboptimal temperature (15 °C), maintained higher rates of electron transport than leaves of sensitive genotypes. This difference was largely due to the ability of the tolerant plants to keep higher efficiency of excitation energy capture by open photosystem II reaction centres (F′v/F′m). The absence of genotypic differences in leaves that developed at optimal temperature indicates that the trait is not expressed constitutively, but relies on adaptation mechanisms. Furthermore, the genotypic difference was not expressed under increasing illumination at 15 °C and 25 °C suggesting that the trait is also low-temperature-specific and is not expressed solely in response to increasing excess light energy. Applying the method to flint and dent breeding population led to a substantial increase (up to 31{\%}) in the photosynthetic capacity of hybrids between selected F3 inbreeding families grown at suboptimal temperature, demonstrating that the method is an efficient selection tool for improving the cold tolerance of maize through breeding.},

abstract = {The use of a chili fruit is distinguished by its capsaicinoid content, which shows many beneficial effects in food and pharmaceutical applications. However, chilies exhibit wide variations in the accumulation of capsaicinoids depending on their genotype and environmental interaction. Therefore, we conducted experiments to evaluate the capsaicinoid responses of 14 cultivars of chili across four different elevations. Experiments were conducted during the rainy season from June to Oct. 2009 at elevations of 200 m asl (Khon Kaen) and 680 m asl (Chiang Mai) in Thailand and from Apr. to Sept. 2010 at elevations of 1400 m asl (Lobesa) and 1630 m asl (Kabesa) in Bhutan. A high-performance liquid chromatography technique was used to determine capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin. Significant differences were observed among the cultivars, the locations, and the cultivar-by-location interactions. Large variations of cultivar effects indicate that it is possible to select cultivars for capsaicinoid concentration that are adapted over a wide range of environments. Average capsaicin, dihydrocapsaicin, and total capsaicinoids were greater at higher elevations in a particular year. There was significant correlation between capsaicin and total capsaicinoid contents with elevations, but capsaicinoid yield showed negative correlation. Small-fruited cultivars with high pungency showed consistent capsaicinoid production over different environments. Dallay khorsaney, KKU-P-22006, KKU-P-31141, and KKU-P-21041 cultivars showed high stability for pungency, producing high capsaicinoids at all four locations.},

In this study, a time-course metabolic change in rice plants was investigated after diazinon treatment using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS), and subsequently the statistical strategy of random forest (RF) was performed in order to find the stress-associated effects. According to the results, a wide range of metabolites were dynamically varied as a result of the plant response to diazinon such as biosynthesis and metabolism of sugars, amino acids, organic acids, and phenylpropanoids, all correlating with the exposure time. Plant response was involved in multiple metabolic pathways, most of which were correlated with the exposure time. In this study, RF was explored as a potential multivariate method for GC–MS analysis of metabolomics data of rice (O. sativa L.) plants under diazinon stress; more than 31 metabolites were quantitatively determined, and time-course metabolic response of the plant during different days after treatment was measured. Results demonstrated RF as a potential multivariate method for GC–MS analysis of changes in plant metabolome under insecticide stress.},

JA-related compounds are widely distributed among higher plants and are potent inducers of expression of several genes, such as the genes of proteinase inhibitor in tomato plants and the genes of vegetative storage proteins in soybean plants. JA is synthesized from linolenic acid by a series of enzymes. The initial reaction in JA synthesis is catalyzed by lipoxygenase, which is a common enzyme in plant tissues. JA-related compounds are easily extracted from plant materials by methanol, ethanol, or acetone. The material should be homogenized immediately after harvest with sufficient solvent to prevent the enzymatic changes of the compounds. JA has four stereoisomers because of the presence of two chiral carbons at the C-1 and C-2 positions of a cyclopentane ring. Maslenkova et al. examined the effect of JA on the oxygen-evolving activity of chloroplasts isolated from barley leaves. The kinetics characteristics of oxygen evolution indicated that JA decreased the value of the total number of oxygen-evolving centers. JA affects the degree of structuring of the granal region or the structural integrity of the electron transport chain in barley chloroplasts.},

abstract = {We review a recent neural implementation of Canonical Correlation Analysis and show, using ideas suggested by Ridge Regression, how to make the algorithm robust. The network is shown to operate on data sets which exhibit multicollinearity. We develop a second model which not only performs as well on multicollinear data but also on general data sets. This model allows us to vary a single parameter so that the network is capable of performing Partial Least Squares regression (at one extreme) to Canonical Correlation Analysis (at the other)and every intermediate operation between the two. On multicollinear data, the parameter setting is shown to be important but on more general data no particular parameter setting is required. Finally, we develop a second penalty term which acts on such data as a smoother in that the resulting weight vectors are much smoother and more interpretable than the weights without the robustification term. We illustrate our algorithms on both artificial and real data.},

abstract = {Rapid decline of seed quality limits soybean production in the lowland tropies. Seed deterioration is promoted by delayed harvest under high ambient temperature and relative humidity. To evaluate changes in respiration during deterioration, soybean seed were subjected to four controlled, constant or fluctuating, water content regimes at 25°C and 32°C to simulate the postmaturation, preharvest environment. Seed deteriorated rapidly under high water content regimes at 32°C and were non-viable by 20 d. Low rates of oxygen uptake during early imbibition correlated with deterioration and were attributed to a decline in the integrity of the cyanide-sensitive cytochrome pathway. However, tissues subjected to high water content fluctuation at 32°C for 20 d had high rates of oxygen uptake due mainly to ‘residual' respiration. Only small increases in alternative respiration and lipoxygenase activity occurred during deterioration. A marked increase in ethanol content during imbibition indicated a shift from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism induced by the decline in the cytochrome pathway. A reduction in tetrazolium staining was not accompanied by decreased activity of alcohol dehydrogenase or malate dehydrogenase. Reduced pyruvate metabolism through the tricarboxylic acid cycle and a concomitant decline in NADH levels were proposed to limit dehydrogenase activity in vivo causing the decreased staining of tissues. The mitochondria appear to be the site of a primary lesion during seed deterioration under combinations of high water content and high temperature.},

abstract = {Plant breeding has been very successful in developing improved varieties using conventional tools and methodologies. Nowadays, the availability of genomic tools and resources is leading to a new revolution of plant breeding, as they facilitate the study of the genotype and its relationship with the phenotype, in particular for complex traits. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies are allowing the mass sequencing of genomes and transcriptomes, which is producing a vast array of genomic information. The analysis of NGS data by means of bioinformatics developments allows discovering new genes and regulatory sequences and their positions, and makes available large collections of molecular markers. Genome-wide expression studies provide breeders with an understanding of the molecular basis of complex traits. Genomic approaches include TILLING and EcoTILLING, which make possible to screen mutant and germplasm collections for allelic variants in target genes. Re-sequencing of genomes is very useful for the genome-wide discovery of markers amenable for high-throughput genotyping platforms, like SSRs and SNPs, or the construction of high density genetic maps. All these tools and resources facilitate studying the genetic diversity, which is important for germplasm management, enhancement and use. Also, they allow the identification of markers linked to genes and QTLs, using a diversity of techniques like bulked segregant analysis (BSA), fine genetic mapping, or association mapping. These new markers are used for marker assisted selection, including marker assisted backcross selection, ‘breeding by design', or new strategies, like genomic selection. In conclusion, advances in genomics are providing breeders with new tools and methodologies that allow a great leap forward in plant breeding, including the ‘superdomestication' of crops and the genetic dissection and breeding for complex traits.},

Using inclusive composite interval mapping (ICIM), a total of nine and eight significant QTLs for GNS were detected in three different environments in DH and I F 2 populations, respectively. QTLs on chromosomes 1A, 2B, 3B, and 6A were observed between two populations. Five QTLs were detected on chromosome 1A. Of these QTLs, QGns1A - 1 was a major QTL explaining 31.25 {\%} of phenotypic variation. QGns2B - 2 detected on chromosome 2B had the most significant additive effects, explaining 46.75 {\%} of phenotypic variation with the favorable allele contributed by Yumai 57 corresponding to an increase of 5.69 kernels. Mid-parent heterosis of each cross in the I F 2 population was used to map heterotic quantitative trait loci. A total of 17 HLs were detected. QTLs and HLs on chromosomes 2B and 6A were observed in the I F 2 population. Three HLs, QHgns1B - 2 , QHgns2B , and QHgns6A - 1 , were detected in two environments and expressed stably. These results showed that some intervals on chromosomes 1B, 2B, and 6A play an important role in GNS heterosis in wheat, improving understanding of this phenomenon.},

abstract = {Methyl jasmonate (MeJa) is a plant chemical elicitor which has been used to artificially induce chemical defensive responses and resistance against herbivores in many plant species in recent decades. In this paper, we studied the effect of exogenous MeJa application at different concentrations (0, 5, 50, and 100 mM) on growth, chemical defenses and resistance against the large pine weevil Hylobius abietis L in one year old Pinus pinaster Ait. seedlings. We also investigated whether the local application of MeJa on a basal branch would distally elicit defensive responses or growth reductions on the opposite branch and on the upper main stem. Exogenous application of MeJa induced resin accumulation in the stems, and enhanced resistance against H. abietis. The resin content in plants treated with 100 mM was nearly two-fold greater, and the pine weevil consumed 80{\%} less phloem than in control plants. However, concentration of total phenolics in needles was lower in plants treated with the higher MeJa dose, probably because of a local toxic effect. We did not detect any effect of MeJa application on plant growth traits. In addition, the application of MeJa on the experimental branches did not significantly affect the resin content, nor growth rates of the opposite untreated control branches. However, the application of MeJa on the experimental branches significantly increased the resin content in the stem and total phenolics in the needles in the apical stem section of the seedling. These results suggest that the systemic effect of the MeJa induction is restricted to the most valuable parts of the seedlings, and should be considered in further studies aimed to understand the systemic resistance of conifers.},

abstract = {Global warming and increasing soybean production in warm regions require a quantitative understanding of how yield-formation processes of this crop are affected by high temperatures. The response of soybean growth to increased temperature was examined under a controlled environment that mimics field conditions using a temperature gradient chamber (TGC). In 2009 and 2010, the (cv) Enrei cultivar was grown in soil culture beds (1 m × 24 m) in two TGCs. Three temperature treatments, Ta (near ambient temperature), Ta + 1 (ambient temperature +1 °C) and Ta + 3 (ambient temperature +3 °C), were established by dividing the rows along which the temperature gradient was created. In 2009, only cvs. Ryuho and Suzuyutaka were grown under two temperature regimes. The mean temperatures in 2009 and 2010 for the entire growth period ranged from 25.9 to 28.7 °C and from 27.1 to 30.1 °C for Ta and Ta + 3, respectively. The individual seed growth rate (SGR) was determined as the linear coefficient of the single-seed weight vs. time (d), based on periodic plant harvesting. The effective seed-filling period (EFP) was calculated by dividing the final single-seed weight by the SGR. The flowering date was affected by increased temperature only in 2010. The days to beginning of seed fill and maturity were longer under higher temperatures. The SGR was slower at Ta + 3 (7.1 and 5.9 mg seed−1 d−1 in 2009 and 2010, respectively) than at Ta (8.5 and 7.5 mg seed−1 d−1 in 2009 and 2010, respectively), whereas the EFP was longer under high temperatures than at near ambient temperature. The final single-seed weight was reduced by increased temperatures. The temperature had no significant effect on cell volume, but the number of cells per cotyledon was smaller at Ta + 3 (3.4 × 106 and 2.6 × 106 in 2009 and 2010, respectively) than at Ta (5.0 × 106 and 4.3 × 106). The results indicated that an increase in temperature by 3 °C in warm regions decreased the seed size of soybean by decreasing the cell number and SGR.},

abstract = {The maize genome is replete with chromosomal duplications and repetitive DNA. The duplications resulted from an ancient polyploid event that occurred over 11 million years ago. Based on DNA sequence data, the polyploid event occurred after the divergence between sorghum and maize, and hence the polyploid event explains some of the difference in DNA content between these two species. Genomic rearrangement and diploidization followed the polyploid event. Most of the repetitive DNA in the maize genome is retrotransposable elements, and they comprise 50{\%} of the genome. Retrotransposon multiplication has been relatively recent—within the last 5–6 million years—suggesting that the proliferation of retrotransposons has also contributed to differences in DNA content between sorghum and maize. There are still unanswered questions about repetitive DNA, including the distribution of repetitive DNA throughout the genome, the relative impacts of retrotransposons and chromosomal duplication in plant genome evolution, and the hypothesized correlation of duplication events with transposition. Population genetic processes also affect the evolution of genomes. We discuss how centromeric genes should, in theory, contain less genetic diversity than noncentromeric genes. In addition, studies of diversity in the wild relatives of maize indicate that different genes have different histories and also show that domestication and intensive breeding have had heterogeneous effects on genetic diversity across genes.},

@article{grunewald_transcription_2012,
abstract = {Gradients of the plant hormone auxin, which depend on its active intercellular transport, are crucial for the maintenance of root meristematic activity. This directional transport is largely orchestrated by a complex interaction of specific influx and efflux carriers that mediate the auxin flow into and out of cells, respectively. Besides these transport proteins, plant-specific polyphenolic compounds known as flavonols have been shown to act as endogenous regulators of auxin transport. However, only limited information is available on how flavonol synthesis is developmentally regulated. Using reduction-of-function and overexpression approaches in parallel, we demonstrate that the WRKY23 transcription factor is needed for proper root growth and development by stimulating the local biosynthesis of flavonols. The expression of WRKY23 itself is controlled by auxin through the AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 7 (ARF7) and ARF19 transcriptional response pathway. Our results suggest a model in which WRKY23 is part of a transcriptional feedback loop of auxin on its own transport through local regulation of flavonol biosynthesis.},

@article{atkin_variation_1998,
abstract = {In this study we assessed the inherent relative growth rate (RGR) under controlled environment conditions of 10 contrasting Acacia species from semi-arid and mesic environments. For several of the species, compound pinnate leaves produced early in the seedling stage, were gradually replaced by phyllodes (expanded petioles that form simple lamina). Other species either did not form phyllodes, or only did so to a minor degree by the end of the study. Phyllode production was dominant in the four slow-growing Acacia species from semi-arid environments (A. aneura, A. colei, A. coriacea and A. tetragonophylla), with leaf production being exclusive or dominant in five (A. dealbata, A. implexa, A. mearnsii, A. melanoxylon and A. irrorata) of the six faster-growing species from mesic environments. The exception was A. saligna which was fast growing but did produce phyllodes. From a carbon economy perspective, slow growth in the semi-arid species was not associated with lower net assimilation rates or less plant mass allocated to foliage. Rather, the primary factor associated with their slow growth was a smaller foliage area per unit foliage mass. This was true for comparisons based on the mean over all harvests or at set plant masses. The production of phyllodes by the semi-arid species substantially reduced foliage area per unit foliage mass, as this was lower for phyllodes than leaves in all species. To assess the impact that phyllode production had on ontogenetic changes in RGR, we modelled the situation where only leaves were formed. This analysis showed that changing from leaves to phyllodes substantially reduced the RGR. There was little difference in plant nitrogen concentration or the ratio of foliage nitrogen to plant nitrogen between the species. This resulted in foliage nitrogen productivity (dry mass gain per unit foliage nitrogen and time) being directly proportional to foliage area per unit foliage mass between species. We concluded that a smaller foliage area per unit foliage mass and phyllode production are the primary factors associated with lower RGR in contrasting Acacia species.},

CO2 strongly promoted ethylene production by the leaves of both species, but did not promote ethylene production by roots; in vivo analysis of ACC oxidase activity with and without 5{\%} CO2 showed that CO2 promoted activity in leaves while it had little or no effect on ACC oxidase activity in roots. In vitro analysis of ACC oxidase extracted from roots and leaves of the two species revealed that substrate Kms, KCO2 and response to pH were different for enzyme extracted from the two organs. These differences were consistent between the two species, indicating that this may be a general phenomenon. ACC and ascorbate levels measured in the different organs corresponded with the differences observed in the KACC and Kascorbate. The data suggest that ACC oxidase may exist as organ specific isoenzymes which are tailored to the environmental and physiological status of each organ. {\textcopyright} 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Mathematical modeling of plant growth has gained increasing interest in recent years due to its potential applications. A general family of models, known as functional–structural plant models (FSPMs) and formalized as dynamic systems, serves as the basis for the current study. Modeling, parameterization and estimation are very challenging problems due to the complicated mechanisms involved in plant evolution. A specific type of a non-homogeneous hidden Markov model has been proposed as an extension of the GreenLab FSPM to study a certain class of plants with known organogenesis. In such a model, the maximum likelihood estimator cannot be derived explicitly. Thus, a stochastic version of an expectation conditional maximization (ECM) algorithm was adopted, where the E-step was approximated by sequential importance sampling with resampling (SISR). The complexity of the E-step creates the need for the design and the comparison of different simulation methods for its approximation. In this direction, three variants of SISR and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach are compared for their efficiency in parameter estimation on simulated and real sugar beet data, where observations are taken by censoring plant's evolution (destructive measurements). The MCMC approach seems to be more efficient for this particular application context and also for a large variety of crop plants. Moreover, a data-driven automated MCMC–ECM algorithm for finding an appropriate sample size in each ECM step and also an appropriate number of ECM steps is proposed. Based on the available real dataset, some competing models are compared via model selection techniques.},

abstract = {Making an impact in more ways than one
Massive eruptions formed the Deccan Traps flood basalts in India at around the same time as the mass extinction event 65 million years ago. Renne et al. precisely dated the massive volcanic field, which suggests a simultaneous increase in volcanism associated with the famous Chicxulub impact. Strong ecologic recovery may have been impossible until the volcanism slowed down 500,000 years later.
Science, this issue p. 76
Bolide impact and flood volcanism compete as leading candidates for the cause of terminal-Cretaceous mass extinctions. High-precision 40Ar/39Ar data indicate that these two mechanisms may be genetically related, and neither can be considered in isolation. The existing Deccan Traps magmatic system underwent a state shift approximately coincident with the Chicxulub impact and the terminal-Cretaceous mass extinctions, after which {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}70{\%} of the Traps' total volume was extruded in more massive and more episodic eruptions. Initiation of this new regime occurred within {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}50,000 years of the impact, which is consistent with transient effects of impact-induced seismic energy. Postextinction recovery of marine ecosystems was probably suppressed until after the accelerated volcanism waned.
High-precision dating of Deccan Traps volcanic units suggests an increase in volcanism associated with the Chicxulub impact.

abstract = {Salt stress affects about 25{\%} of the 4.4 million ha of irrigated and lowland systems for rice cultivation in West Africa (WA). A major quantitative trait locus (QTLs) on chromosome 1 (Saltol) that enhances tolerance to salt stress at the vegetative stage has enabled the use of marker-assisted selection (MAS) to develop salt-tolerant rice cultivar(s) in WA. We used 3 cycles of backcrossing with selection based on DNA markers and field-testing using ‘FL478' as tolerant donor and the widely grown ‘Rassi' as recurrent parent. In the BC3F2 stage, salt-tolerant lines with over 80{\%} Rassi alleles except in the region around Saltol segment were selected. 429 introgression lines (Saltol-ILs) were identified as tolerant at vegetative stage, of which 116 were field-tested for four seasons at the reproductive stage. Sixteen Saltol-ILs had less yield loss (3–26{\%} relative to control trials), and 8 Saltol-ILs showed high yield potential under stress and non-stress conditions. The 16 Saltol-ILs had been included for further African-wide testing prior to release in 6 WA countries. MAS reduced the time for germplasm improvement from at least 7 to about 4 years. Our objective is to combine different genes/QTLs conferring tolerance to stresses under one genetic background using MAS.},

abstract = {Many complex traits are highly correlated rather than independent. By taking the correlation structure of multiple traits into account, joint association analyses can achieve both higher statistical power and more accurate estimation. To develop a statistical approach to joint association analysis that includes allele detection and genetic effect estimation, we combined multivariate partial least squares regression with variable selection strategies and selected the optimal model using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). We then performed extensive simulations under varying heritabilities and sample sizes to compare the performance achieved using our method with those obtained by single-trait multilocus methods. Joint association analysis has measurable advantages over single-trait methods, as it exhibits superior gene detection power, especially for pleiotropic genes. Sample size, heritability, polymorphic information content (PIC), and magnitude of gene effects influence the statistical power, accuracy and precision of effect estimation by the joint association analysis.},

@article{zucker_tannins:_1983,
abstract = {Tannins are phenolic compounds of widespread occurrence in higher plants. They have complicated structures that have only recently been unraveled by natural products chemists. They are not known to have any physiological function. So what do they do? Examination of their structures and consideration of several possible roles, especially as defensive compounds against plants' enemies, allows much speculation. It is proposed that the enormous structural heterogeneity and natural division of tannins into two broad classes, the condensed and hydrolyzable, has important ecological consequences. It is argued that their structures suggest strong specificities for a variety of target molecules including proteins, digestive enzymes, and polysaccharides. These specificities insure mainline defense against plant enemies, but are nevertheless subject to the coevolutionary "arms race" (Feeny 1976). The idea that condensed tannins are reserved primarily for defense against microbes and pathogens, while the hydrolyzable tannins protect the plant against herbivores is discussed. What structure suggests about function, and how these ideas fit into the current scheme of antiherbivore chemistry, evolution of the arms race between plants and their parasites, and ecological theory is considered.},

abstract = {Studies that provide representative insights for determining yield through its related traits during the ontogeny of modern cultivars subjected to sources of environmental variation are limited for different crops, including wheat. Most of the empirical evidence on the relationships between the yield of small grain cereal crops and its contributing traits has been obtained under dry or semidry conditions. The aims of this paper were to (1) illustrate how an path analysis can be used to clarify and interpret the relationships between grain yield (GY), yield components, and other yield-related traits of 25 winter wheat cultivars subjected to sources of environmental variation and (2) determine how the yield-related traits contribute to the yield variation. The data used in this analysis were generated from multi-environment trials across wheat-growing areas in Poland. Using Ward's clustering procedure was capable of identifying the most critical predictor traits of the yield components and their contributions to cultivar-focused GY variation. Our findings document, confirm, and improve the basic biological understanding of how to grow modern wheat cultivars for high GY through effectively stimulating the improvement of yield-related traits through the optimization of developmental stage-based agronomic strategies. Our results confirmed empirically that modern European wheat cultivars grown in a temperate climate require favorable conditions, the use of appropriate N fertilizer and growth regulators, and the application of fungicide to protect against leaf diseases and to provide conditions that effectively increase the time to anthesis, the Leaf Area Index per spike at anthesis, and the grain filling duration, and reduce plant height and flag leaf disease severity, thus leading to a high GY. A high yield level is obtained by the performance of preferred yield-related traits that can maintain the three yield components at relatively high levels.},

@article{punja_genetic_2001,
abstract = {Recent applications of techniques in plant molecular biology and biotechnology to the study of hostpathogen interactions have resulted in the identification and cloning of numerous genes involved in the defense responses of plants following pathogen infection. These include: genes that express proteins, peptides, or antimicrobial compounds that are directly toxic to pathogens or that reduce their growth in situ; gene products that directly inhibit pathogen virulence products or enhance plant structural defense genes, that directly or indirectly activate general plant defense responses; and resistance genes involved in the hypersensitive response and in the interactions with avirulence factors. The introduction and expression of these genes, as well as of antimicrobial genes from nonplant sources, in a range of transgenic plant species have shown that the development of fungal pathogens can be significantly reduced. The extent of disease reduction varies with the strategy employed as well as with the characteristics of the fungal pathogen, and disease control has never been complete. Manipulation of salicylic acid, ethylene, and cytokinin levels in transgenic plants have provided some interesting results with regard to enhanced disease tolerance or susceptibility. The complex interactions among the expressed gene product, plant species, and fungal pathogen indicate that the response of transgenic plants cannot be readily predicted. Combinations of defense gene products have shown considerably more promise in reducing disease than single-transgene introductions. The use of tissue-specific or pathogen-inducible promoters, and the engineered expression of resistance genes, synthetic antimicrobial peptides, and elicitor molecules that induce defense responses have the potential to provide commercially useful broad-spectrum disease resistance in the not-too-distant future. The issues and challenges that will need to be addressed prior to the widespread utilization of these transgenic plants are highlighted.},

abstract = {Reproductive development in maize (Zea mays L.) is vulnerable to plant water deficits during anthesis but becomes less sensitive as reproduction progresses. To determine whether changes in tissue water status correlated with the change in sensitivity, we examined the water potential (Psi(w)), osmotic potential (Psi(s)), and turgor of reproductive tissues during a short-term water deficit imposed at anthesis or mid-grain fill. Plants were grown in controlled environments in soil. At anthesis, leaf, husk, silk, and ovary Psi(w) of control plants was similar (-0.5 to -0.65 megapascal) at midday. When water was withheld, Psi(w) decreased to -1.75, -1.3, -1.2, and -1.0 megapascal in these tissues. Net water uptake by the ovaries was inhibited, but final dry weight, solute content, and total extractable carbohydrates were similar to the controls. At mid-grain fill, leaf, husk, grain, and embryo Psi(w) of control plants were -0.55, -0.35, -0.75, and -0.80 megapascal at midday. When water was withheld, leaf and husk Psi(w) decreased to -2.4 and -1.4 megapascal within 6 days. However, grain and embryo Psi(w) remained within 0.15 megapascal of control values. The grain continued to accumulate dry matter despite a net loss of water and a reduction in total solute content. These results indicate that the response of the reproductive tissues to plant water deficits varies with stage of grain development. The maintenance of a favorable water status only after grain filling is under way may explain, at least in part, the high sensitivity to plant water deficits early in reproductive development and the decrease in sensitivity as reproduction progresses.},

JAs are known to mediate defense responses against herbivores, necrotrophic pathogens, nematodes and other micro-organism besides alleviating abiotic stresses including UV-stress, osmotic stress, salt stress, cold stress, temperature stress, heavy metal stress, ozone stress etc. Jasmonate signaling does not work alone while mediating defense responses in plants but it functions in multifarious crosstalk network with other phytohormone signaling pathways such as auxin, gibberellic acid (GA), and salicylic acid. The present review gives the holistic approach about the role of jasmonates in counteracting the stress whether biotic or abiotic. Jasmonates regulate beneficial plant–microbe interactions, such as interactions with plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.},

abstract = {In response to herbivore damage, several plant species emit volatiles that attract natural predators of the attacking herbivores. Using spider mites (Tetranychus urticae) and predatory mites (Phytoseiulus persimilis), it has been shown that not only the attacked plant but also neighbouring plants are affected, becoming more attractive to predatory mites and less susceptible to spider mites. The mechanism involved in such interactions, however, remains elusive. Here we show that uninfested lima bean leaves activate five separate defence genes when exposed to volatiles from conspecific leaves infested with T. urticae, but not when exposed to volatiles from artificially wounded leaves. The expression pattern of these genes is similar to that produced by exposure to jasmonic acid. At least three terpenoids in the volatiles are responsible for this gene activation; they are released in response to herbivory but not artificial wounding. Expression of these genes requires calcium influx and protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation.},

Therefore, it is critical to understand the mechanism of this process to optimize atmospheric conditions during postharvest pear storage.

Yali) were investigated under modified atmosphere packaging (MAP). The results showed that MAP1 (with a thickness of 10 $\mu$m) reduced core browning, retarded the peak appearance of PPO activity and phenolic content, and inhibited the expression of PbPAL1, PbPAL2, and PbPPO1 genes in core tissue relative to the control (which had no packaging), but MAP2 (with a thickness of 30 $\mu$m) exerted the opposite effects during cold storage (0 °C). There was no significant relation between PbPPO4, PbPPO5 and PbPPO6 expression in core tissue and core browning. These results suggested that MAP1 was suitable for cold storage and that the PbPAL1, PbPAL2 and PbPPO1 genes might be involved in core browning under modified atmosphere storage in ‘Yali' pears.},

Mixed solution of ammonium and nitrate could effectively reduce oxalate accumulation, while the mechanism involved remains unknown. High (Heizhenzhu) and low (Weilv) oxalate-accumulated spinach genotypes were used in this study to investigate the association of oxalate accumulation and root uptake of nitrogen. Exposure of increasing nitrate or mixed-nitrogen (nitrate:ammonium = 1:1) significantly increased leaf total and soluble oxalate contents. In contrast, increasing ammonium did not result in elevation of leaf oxalate. Correlation analysis confirmed that leaf oxalate accumulation was positively associated with root uptake of nitrate but not ammonium. Moreover, addition of ammonium significantly reduced nitrate uptake rate, and subsequently decreased leaf oxalate accumulation. The results suggest that oxalate synthesis in spinach leaves is associated with its root uptake of nitrate, and ammonium is able to reduce oxalate accumulation by inhibiting uptake of nitrate.},

Summary
Conifers are long-lived organisms, and part of their success is due to their potent defense mechanisms. This review focuses on bark defenses, a front line against organisms trying to reach the nutrient-rich phloem. A major breach of the bark can lead to tree death, as evidenced by the millions of trees killed every year by specialized bark-invading insects. Different defense strategies have arisen in conifer lineages, but the general strategy is one of overlapping constitutive mechanical and chemical defenses overlaid with the capacity to up-regulate additional defenses. The defense strategy incorporates a graded response from ‘repel', through ‘defend' and ‘kill', to ‘compartmentalize', depending upon the advance of the invading organism. Using a combination of toxic and polymer chemistry, anatomical structures and their placement, and inducible defenses, conifers have evolved bark defense mechanisms that work against a variety of pests. However, these can be overcome by strategies including aggregation pheromones of bark beetles and introduction of virulent phytopathogens. The defense structures and chemicals in conifer bark are reviewed and questions about their coevolution with bark beetles are discussed.},

abstract = {Soybean cultivars present seeds of different physiological quality and they lose vigor and germinative potential during their permanence in the field after maturity. Therefore, this study was settled to evaluate the response ability to osmotic conditioning of seeds of six soybean cultivars - Confian{\c{c}}a, UFV-16, Splendor, Garantia, UFVS 2005 and UFV-18 - harvested at the R8 stage and 15 and 30 days later. The cultivars were multiplied in the field, in a randomized complete-block design, with four replications. The osmotic conditioning of the seeds were carried out with a polyethylene glycol solution (PEG 6000), at -0,8 MPa, with 0.2{\%} of Captan fungicide, at 20 °C, during 96 hours. Non conditioned seeds were used as control. The following characteristics were evaluated: first and final counting on germination test; seedling emergence rate and emergence speed index in the field; and electric conductivity. Harvest delay decreases seed germination and vigor, with different intensity, depending on the cultivar. The osmoconditioning reduces the leaching of solutes by the seed and positively affects the seed germination and vigor of all cultivar studied, more pronouncedly when seeds are much more weathered.},

abstract = {We tested expectations that two desert shrubs would differ in germination and seedling relative growth rate (RGR) responses to Na and $\Psi$s stress. The study species, Chrysothamnus nauseosus ssp. consimilis and Sarcobatus vermiculatus (hereafter referred to by genus), differ in their distribution along salinity gradients, with Chrysothamnus inhabiting only less saline areas. In growth chamber studies, declining $\Psi$s (−0.82 to −2.71 MPa) inhibited germination of both species, and Chrysothamnus was less tolerant of $\Psi$s stress than Sarcobatus. Germination fell below 10{\%} for Chrysothamnus at −1.64 MPa (NaCl and PEG), and for Sarcobatus at −2.4 MPa PEG. Neither species exhibited ion toxicity. There was substantial ion enhancement for Sarcobatus in lower $\Psi$s, allowing for 40{\%} germination in −2.71 MPa NaCl. For seedling RGR, species were not different at −0.29 or −0.82 MPa (0 and 100 mmol/L NaCl, respectively), but Chrysothamnus RGR declined substantially at −1.3 MPa (200 mmol/L NaCl). The greater stress tolerance of Sarcobatus was not associated with a lower RGR under nonsaline conditions. Species differences in seed and seedling $\Psi$s stress tolerance probably contribute to the restricted distribution of Chrysothamnus to less saline areas. The Na uptake of Sarcobatus seedlings enhances its ability to deal with declining $\Psi$s and establish in more saline areas.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT The objectives of this work were to adjust nonlinear regression models for the green beans production and to identify the plot size which provides the best explanation and adjustment to the models. The authors used two field and two protected environment (plastic tunnel) trials in the autumn-winter and spring-summer seasons. The logistic and von Bertalanffy models were adjusted for average weight of green beans accumulated after multiple harvests and with different plot sizes. The models presented similar estimates and the same parameters estimates in all the plot sizes. The logistic model provided estimates closest to the reality, showing the best description performance for the average weight of pods during the productive cycle. In the autumn-winter season, plot size of 14 basic units (28 plants in the cultivation line direction) in the field and of two basic units (four plants in the cultivation line direction) under the plastic tunnel provide a good quality in the models adjustment. In the spring-summer season, the plot sizes are made of six basic units (12 plants in the cultivation line) in the field and seven basic units (14 plants in the cultivation line) under the plastic tunnel.},

abstract = {As saline soils dry, the salt in the remaining solution phase is concentrated and the microbes are subjected to both water and osmotic stress. However, little is known about the interactive effect of matric potential (MP) and osmotic potential (OP) on microbial activity and community structure. We conducted an experiment in which two non-saline soils, a sand and a sandy loam, were pre-incubated at optimal water content (for microbial activity) but different osmotic potentials achieved by adding NaCl. The EC of the saturated paste (ECe) ranged between 1.6 and 11.6 dS m −1 in the sand and between 0.6 and 17.7 dS m −1 in the sandy loam. After the 14-day pre-incubation, the soils were dried to different water contents: 25–35 g kg −1 in the sand and 95–200 g kg −1 in the sandy loam. Water potential (WP, the sum of osmotic + matric potential) ranged from −0.7 to −6.8 MPa in the sand and from −0.1 to −4.4 MPa in the sandy loam. After addition of ground pea straw to increase the concentration of readily available substrate, respiration was measured over 14 days and microbial community composition was assessed by phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA) at the end of the experiment. In both soils, cumulative respiration at a given soil water content (WC) decreased with decreasing osmotic potential, but the effect of decreasing water content differed between the two soils. In the sand, cumulative respiration at the two lowest water contents (WC25 and WC28) was always significantly lower than that at the highest water content (WC35). In the sandy loam, cumulative respiration was significantly lower at the lowest water content (WC95) compared to the highest water content (WC200) only in treatments with added salt. The reduction of cumulative respiration at a given WP was similar in the two soils with a 50{\%} reduction compared to the control (optimal water content, no salt added) at WP −3 MPa. In the sand at WP {\{}{\textless}{\}}−2 MPa, the reduction in fungal fatty acids was greater than that of bacterial fatty acids whereas in the sandy loam, the response of bacteria and fungi to decreasing WP was similar. In both soils, microbial biomass decreased by 35–50{\%} as WP decreased to about −2 MPa but then remained stable with further decreases of WP. Microbial community composition changed with WP in both soils. Our results suggest that there are two strategies by which microbes respond to water potential. A decrease in WP up to −2 MPa kills a proportion of the microbial community, but the remaining microbes adapt and maintain their activity per unit biomass. At lower WP however, the adaptation mechanisms are not sufficient and although the microbes survive, their activity per unit biomass is reduced., Highlights ► For the first time, we show the combined effects of salinity and soil water content on soil microbial activity and community composition. ► Water potential (WP) was a better measure of microbial stress than salinity (EC) or soil water content. ► The reduction of cumulative respiration at a given WP was similar in the two soils with a 50{\%} reduction compared to the control (optimal water content, no salt added) at WP −3 MPa. ► In both soils, the microbial biomass decreased by 35–50{\%} as WP decreased to about −2 MPa but then remained stable with further decreases, suggesting that a proportion of the biomass is tolerant to low WP.},

We show via simulation that when the variance or skew of the treatment distributions differ, application of Friedman's test to detect differences in treatment location can result in Type I error probabilities larger than the nominal $\alpha$, and even when $\alpha$ is unaffected, the power of the test can be less than expected.},

A common approach to sample-size planning uses the sample effect size from a prior study as an estimate of the population value of the effect to be detected in the future study. Although this strategy is intuitively appealing, effect-size estimates, taken at face value, are typically not accurate estimates of the population effect size because of publication bias and uncertainty. We show that the use of this approach often results in underpowered studies, sometimes to an alarming degree. We present an alternative approach that adjusts sample effect sizes for bias and uncertainty, and we demonstrate its effectiveness for several experimental designs. Furthermore, we discuss an open-source R package, BUCSS, and user-friendly Web applications that we have made available to researchers so that they can easily implement our suggested methods. },

Multi-model ensemble scenarios are used to deal with uncertainties in climate change projections for the study period (2015–2044). On average, monthly temperature will increase by 1.1 to 1.5 °C under climate change. Monthly precipitation changes may be positive or negative in different months of the year. Nevertheless, on the annual basis, precipitation will decrease by 11 to 31{\%} with climate change. While warming can potentially shorten the crop growth period, crop production and water productivity of all crops are expected to decrease due to lower precipitation and higher water requirements under higher temperature. Out of the four studied crops, rice and corn are more vulnerable to climate change due to their high irrigation water demand. So, their continued production can be compromised under climate change. This finding is of particular importance, given the locally high economic and food value of these crops in central Iran.},

Ammonium (NH4+) toxicity is an issue of global ecological and economic importance. In this review, we discuss the major themes of NH4+ toxicity, including the occurrence of NH4+ in the biosphere, response differences to NH4+ nutrition among wild and domesticated species, symptoms and proposed mechanisms underlying toxicity, and means by which it can be alleviated. Where possible, nitrate (NO3−) nutrition is used as point of comparison. Particular emphasis is placed on issues of cellular pH, ionic balance, relationships with carbon biochemistry, and bioenergetics of primary NH4+ transport. Throughout, we attempt to identify areas that are controversial, and areas that are in need of further examination.},

Among others, Dasycladus vermicularis (Scopoli) Krasser 1898 uses a sulfated hydroxylated coumarin derivative as storage metabolite for a protein cross linker that can be activated upon mechanical disruption of the alga. We introduce a comprehensive monitoring technique for sulfated metabolites based on fragmentation patterns in liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry and applied it to Dasycladales. This allowed the identification of two new aromatic sulfate esters 4-(sulfooxy)phenylacetic acid and 4-(sulfooxy)benzoic acid. The two metabolites were synthesized to prove the mass spectrometry-based structure elucidation in co-injections. We show that both metabolites are transformed to the corresponding desulfated phenols by sulfatases of bacteria. In biofouling experiments with Escherichia coli and Vibrio natriegens the desulfated forms were more active than the sulfated ones. Sulfatation might thus represent a measure of detoxification that enables the algae to store inactive forms of metabolites that are activated by settling organisms and then act as defense.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The objective of this work was to characterize the chemical properties of white oat (Avena sativa) caryopsis and to determine the adaptability and stability of cultivars recommended for cultivation in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The trials were carried out in the 2007, 2008 and 2009 crop seasons, in three municipalities: Augusto Pestana, Cap{\~{a}}o do Le{\~{a}}o, and Passo Fundo. Fifteen cultivars were evaluated in a randomized block design, with four replicates. The contents of protein, lipid, and nitrogen-free extract were evaluated in the caryopsis. Cultivar performances for the measured characters varied according to location and year of cultivation. The cultivar URS Guapa showed high content of nitrogen-free extract and low contents of protein and lipid in the caryopsis. 'FAPA Louise' showed high content of lipid, whereas 'Albasul', 'UPF 15', and 'UPF 18' showed high content of protein and low content of nitrogen-free extract. There is no evidence of an ideal biotype for the evaluated characters, which could simultaneously show high average performance, adaptability to favorable and unfavorable environments, and stability.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {It is known that chicory inulin (average degree of polymerisation DP=10) and oligofructose (DP=4) affect bowel function. Whereas transit time is not affected with daily doses ranging between 4 and 15g, such doses increase stool frequency and have a faecal bulking effect in healthy volunteers.

Recently a new type of chicory inulin with higher average chain length (DP=25) has become commercially available. From a nutritional point of view this is an interesting carbohydrate, as it is fermented more slowly than the native product, giving it the opportunity to arrive in more distal parts of the colon.

In this placebo controlled study, we investigated the effect of this high performance inulin on bowel function in healthy volunteers with low stool frequency (1 stool every 2 to 3 days).

Subjects were administered 15g of the product/day for 2 weeks. Besides macroscopic observations (stool frequency, faecal bulking, etc.), or-caecal transit time, effect on intestinal permeability, amount of faecal fat, bile acids, dry solids, etc. were monitored.

There was a significant increase in stool frequency with the high performance inulin (p=0.02). The earlier observed trend to increase faecal bulk with 1.5 to 2g per g inulin ingested was observed in present study as well. There were no effects on the other measured parameters.},

@article{li_crbpf1_2015,
abstract = {Terpenoid indole alkaloid (TIA) biosynthesis in Catharanthus roseus is a complex and highly regulated process. Understanding the biochemistry and regulation of the TIA pathway is of particular interest as it may allow the engineering of plants to accumulate higher levels of pharmaceutically important alkaloids. Toward this end, we generated a transgenic C. roseus hairy root line that overexpresses the CrBPF1 transcriptional activator under the control of a $\beta$-estradiol inducible promoter. CrBPF1 is a MYB-like protein that was previously postulated to help regulate the expression of the TIA biosynthetic gene STR. However, the role of CrBPF1 in regulation of the TIA and related pathways had not been previously characterized. In this study, transcriptional profiling revealed that overexpression of CrBPF1 results in increased transcript levels for genes from both the indole and terpenoid biosynthetic pathways that provide precursors for TIA biosynthesis, as well as for genes in the TIA biosynthetic pathway. In addition, overexpression of CrBPF1 causes increases in the transcript levels for 11 out of 13 genes postulated to act as transcriptional regulators of genes from the TIA and TIA feeder pathways. Interestingly, overexpression of CrBPF1 causes increased transcript levels for both TIA transcriptional activators and repressors. Despite the fact that CrBPF1 overexpression affects transcript levels of a large percentage of TIA biosynthetic and regulatory genes, CrBPF1 overexpression has only very modest effects on the levels of the TIA metabolites analyzed. This finding may be due, at least in part, to the up-regulation of both transcriptional activators and repressors in response to CrBPF1 overexpression, suggesting that CrBPF1 may serve as a “fine-tune” regulator for TIA biosynthesis, acting to help regulate the timing and amplitude of TIA gene expression.},

abstract = {Measurements of the rate of imbibition by isolated cotyledons of soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr cv Wayne) indicated that water uptake rates were slowed by low temperatures and by low initial moisture contents of the tissue. The role of water viscosity in the temperature effects on imbibition was examined, and a linear relation between imbibition rate and the reciprocal of viscosity was found only for seeds of very high initial moisture content. Adding solutes which lowered the surface tension, or increased the wetting ability of the water, yielded markedly increased rates of imbibition, especially for tissue of low initial moisture content. The data are interpreted as indicating a first component of water entry which is a wetting reaction influenced by the surface tension of the water, and a second component which resembles water flow through a porous matrix and is influenced by the water viscosity. We speculate that damage to soybeans during imbibition, such as in the case of chilling injury, may be particularly related to the initial wetting reaction rather than to the longer-term imbibitional rate.},

Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a classic method of multivariate analysis; it has however rarely been applied to multivariate regression. In the present study, we applied PLS and regularized CCA (RCCA) to high-dimensional data where the number of variables (p) exceeds the number of observations (N), N ≪ p. Using kernel CCA with linear kernel can drastically reduce the calculation time of RCCA. We applied these methods to gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) data, which were analyzed to resolve the problem of Japanese green tea ranking. To construct a quality-predictive model, the optimal number of latent variables in RCCA determined by leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) was significantly fewer than in PLS. For metabolic fingerprinting, we successfully identified important metabolites for green tea grade classification using PLS and RCCA.},

abstract = {At present, there are many software procedures available enabling statisticians to fit linear mixed models (LMMs) to continuous dependent variables in clustered or longitudinal data sets. LMMs are flexible tools for analyzing relationships among variables in these types of data sets, in that a variety of covariance structures can be used depending on the subject matter under study. The explicit random effects in LMMs allow analysts to make inferences about the variability between clusters or subjects in larger hypothetical populations, and examine cluster- or subject-level variables that explain portions of this variability. These models can also be used to analyze longitudinal or clustered data sets with data that are missing at random (MAR), and can accommodate time-varying covariates in longitudinal data sets. While the software procedures currently available have many features in common, more specific analytic aspects of fitting LMMs (e.g., crossed random effects, appropriate hypothesis testing for variance components, diagnostics, incorporating sampling weights) may only be available in selected software procedures. With this article, we aim to perform a comprehensive and up-to-date comparison of the current capabilities of software procedures for fitting LMMs, and provide statisticians with a guide for selecting a software procedure appropriate for their analytic goals.},

Compared to field crops, cell cultures offer major advantages like—compounds would be produced year round under controlled environmental conditions securing a steady supply, regulation of metabolic processes would maximize yields, and cells would be genetically modified to accumulate specific intermediates and metabolites. The most important prerequisite for the use of plant cells in the commercial production of substances of therapeutic use is their adaptability to the conditions of submerged culture.

A binary mixture of low-dose Cd (9 µmol L−1) and high-dose Cu (900 µmol L−1) showed toxicity to the seedlings, indicated by the significant augmentation in leaf malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduction in leaf chlorophylls. The toxicity of the combined metals was significantly alleviated by the addition of exogenous JA at 1 µmol L−1, and the chlorophyll and MDA contents were found to be restored to levels comparable to those of the control. Compare to treatment with Cd and Cu only, 1 and 10 µmol L−1 JA significantly enhanced the ascorbate peroxidase activity, and 10 µmol L−1 JA significantly decreased the uptake of Cd in A. marina leaves. The relative expression of leaf AmMT2 gene was also significantly enhanced by 1 and 10 µmol L−1 JA, which helped reduce Cd toxicity in A. marina seedlings.},

abstract = {Despite the availability of numerous drugs and other therapeutic modalities, the prevention and cure of over- and under-nutrition triggered metabolic and other disease states continues as a major challenge for modern medicine. Such silently progressing and eventually life-threatening diseases often accompany diverse spectrum of comorbid psychiatric disorders. Majority of the global population suffering from metabolic diseases live in economically developing or underdeveloped countries, where due to socioeconomic, cultural, and other reasons, therapies may be unavailable. Evidence from preclinical, clinical, and epidemiological studies of numerous structurally and functionally diverse secondary metabolites of plants suggest that many of these could be promising therapeutic leads for the treatment and prevention of malnutrition-associated diseases and mental health problems. The review discusses the potential therapeutic uses of secondary plant metabolites and their bacterial and mammalian catabolites based on their bioactivity profiles, with special emphasis on their modulating effects on gut microbial ecology and physiological stress responses. Based on concepts in medicinal chemistry and pharmacology considerations that evolved during the author's interactions with David Triggle, secondary plant metabolites may represent an alternative and economically feasible approach to new drugs.},

abstract = {As sessile organisms, plants need to continuously adjust their responses to external stimuli to cope with changing growth conditions. Since the seed dispersal range is often rather limited, exposure of progeny to the growth conditions of parents is very probable. The plasticity of plant phenotypes cannot be simply explained by genetic changes such as point mutations, deletions, insertions and gross chromosomal rearrangements. Since many environmental stresses persist for only one or several plant generations, other mechanisms of adaptation must exist. The heritability of reversible epigenetic modifications that regulate gene expression without changing DNA sequence makes them an attractive alternative mechanism. In this review, we discuss recent advances in understanding how changes in genome stability and epigenetically mediated changes in gene expression could contribute to plant adaptation. We provide examples of environmentally induced transgenerational epigenetic effects that include the appearance of new phenotypes in successive generations of stressed plants. We also describe several cases in which exposure to stress leads to nonrandom heritable but reversible changes in stress tolerance in the progeny of stressed plants.},

A randomized block experimental design in factorial arrangement, with two sulfur managements (with and without) and four split nitrogen managements (I: 100{\%} of N in the double ring; II: 30{\%} of N in the tillering period + 40{\%} of N in the double ring + 30{\%} of N in the ear development; III: 50{\%} of N in the tillering period + 50{\%} of N in the double ring; IV: 50{\%} of N in the double ring + 50{\%} of N in the ear development period), arranged in four repetitions. Our results showed that the sulfur supplementation increased the gluten content, which has been positively correlated with the strength and extensibility of the bread dough. This had a positive influence on the technological parameters of the flour used for baking. The splitnitrogen fertilizer application (in double ring, tillering, and ear development) increased the wheat grain yield due to the greater number of tillers per plant and also of the wheat ears per square meter.},

We evaluated to what extent differences in seed weight and seed phosphorus (P) content among genotypes and within genotypes affect plant growth at low and high P supply. Methods Seedling growth of 42 soybean genotypes was evaluated in a pot trial. In addition, plant growth of selected genotypes was evaluated at different growth stages in two pot trials using various seed lots differing in seed weight per genotype. Results Correlations between seed weight and plant biomass, shoot P content and root length among 42 genotypes were stronger at low than at high P supply. Within-genotype variation in seed weight affected shoot and root growth at different plant growth stages. At low P supply, plant growth was correlated with seed weight up to the flowering stage. Conclusions It is concluded that seed weight largely affects growth especially at low P supply. Confounding effects due to variation in seed weight must be taken into account when screening soybean genotypes for low P tolerance.},

Most plant variables showed strong ontogenetic changes; they were highly dependent on the biomass of the plant. 3. Growth rate was highest at intermediate light levels (25–50{\%}) above which it declined. Most plant variables showed a curvilinear response to irradiance, with the largest changes at the lowest light levels. 4. There was a consistent ranking in growth between species; species that were fast growing in a low-light environment were also fast growing in a high-light environment. 5. At low light, interspecific variation in relative growth rate was determined mainly by differences in a morphological trait, the leaf area ratio (LAR), whereas at high light it was determined mainly by differences in a physiological trait, the net assimilation rate (NAR). 6. NAR became a stronger determinant of growth than LAR in more than 10–15{\%} daylight. As light availability in the forest is generally much lower than this threshold level, it follows that interspecific variation in growth in a forest environment is mainly owing to variation in morphology.},

abstract = {Field studies were conducted to determine the potential for alterations in photosynthetic performance and grain yield of four wheat (Triticum aestivum) varieties of India- Vidisha, Purna, Swarna and Naveen Chandausi by ambient ultraviolet radiation (UV). The plants were grown in specially designed UV exclusion chambers, wrapped with filters that excluded UV-B ({\textless}315 nm), UV-A/B ({\textless}400 nm) or transmitted ambient UV or lacked filters. The results indicated that solar UV exclusion increased the leaf mass per area ratio, leaf weight ratio and chlorophylls per unit area of flag leaves in all the four varieties of wheat. Polyphasic chlorophyll a fluorescence transients from the flag leaves of UV excluded wheat plants gave a higher fluorescence yield. Exclusion of solar UV significantly enhanced photosynthetic performance as a consequence of increased efficiency of PS II, performance index (PIABS) and rate of photosynthesis in the flag leaves of wheat varieties along with a remarkable increase in carbonic anhydrase, Rubisco and nitrate reductase activities. This additional fixation of carbon and nitrogen by exclusion of UV was channelized towards the improvement in grain yield of wheat varieties as there was a decrease in the UV-B absorbing substances and an increase in soluble protein content in flag leaves of all the four varieties of wheat. The magnitude of response for UV exclusion for all the measured parameters was higher in two varieties of wheat Vidisha and Purna as compared to Swarna and Naveen Chandausi. Cumulative stress response index (CSRI) for each variety was developed from the cumulative sum of physiological and yield parameters such as leaf mass area ratio of flag leaf, total chlorophyll content, performance index at absorption basis, rate of photosynthesis and grain yield. All the varieties had a negative CSRI, demonstrating a negative impact of ambient UV radiation. Naveen Chandausi and Swarna are less sensitive to ambient UV radiation; Vidisha is more sensitive to both UV-A and UV-B and Purna is more sensitive to ambient UV-B radiation.},

@article{cakmak_glyphosate_2009-1,
abstract = {Greenhouse experiments were conducted to study the effects of glyphosate drift on plant growth and concentrations of mineral nutrients in leaves and seeds of non-glyphosate resistant soybean plants (Glycine max, L.). Glyphosate was sprayed on plant shoots at increasing rates between 0.06 and 1.2{\%} of the recommended application rate for weed control. In an experiment with 3-week-old plants, increasing application of glyphosate on shoots significantly reduced chlorophyll concentration of the young leaves and shoots dry weight, particularly the young parts of plants. Concentration of shikimate due to increasing glyphosate rates was nearly 2-fold for older leaves and 16-fold for younger leaves compared to the control plants without glyphosate spray. Among the mineral nutrients analyzed, the leaf concentrations of potassium (K), phosphorus (P), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) were not affected, or even increased significantly in case of P and Cu in young leaves by glyphosate, while the concentrations of calcium (Ca), manganese (Mn) and magnesium (Mg) were reduced, particularly in young leaves. In the case of Fe, leaf concentrations showed a tendency to be reduced by glyphosate. In the second experiment harvested at the grain maturation, glyphosate application did not reduce the seed concentrations of nitrogen (N), K, P, Zn and Cu. Even, at the highest application rate of glyphosate, seed concentrations of N, K, Zn and Cu were increased by glyphosate. By contrast, the seed concentrations of Ca, Mg, Fe and Mn were significantly reduced by glyphosate. These results suggested that glyphosate may interfere with uptake and retranslocation of Ca, Mg, Fe and Mn, most probably by binding and thus immobilizing them. The decreases in seed concentration of Fe, Mn, Ca and Mg by glyphosate are very specific, and may affect seed quality.},

abstract = {Genetic improvement for seed yield and oil-content in sunflower cultivars was initiated in the early 1970s in South Africa. Since then no study has been carried out to assess the progress and contribution of new cultivars to seed yield improvement to justify continued investment into breeding new cultivars. The aim of this study was therefore to quantify the contribution of new cultivars to seed yield and associated traits in sunflower over four decades of breeding in South Africa. Two data-sets were used in this study: (1) side-by-side evaluation of historical and current sets of popular cultivars in the same environment under one set of trial management practices; and (2) yield trends in commercial farmers' fields based on annual production estimates. The absolute genetic gain (yield increase per year) for seed yield in the side-by-side trials ranged from 18 to 32 kg ha−1 year−1 with a mean of 24 kg ha−1 year−1. In contrast, the absolute seed yield increase under commercial production was 12 kg ha−1 year−1. The estimated relative genetic gain for seed yield based on side-by-side trials was 1.5{\%} year−1 and the relative gain in seed yield per year under commercial production was 1.9{\%} year−1. The contribution of new cultivars to total seed yield progress in sunflower were 56.3{\%} for the period 1970–1989; 23.9{\%} from 1990 to 2009 and the mean over the four decades under consideration 1970–2009 was 41.6{\%}. Positive increases in genetic gains for oil yield, oil content and number of seeds per head were also obtained although the gain in oil content was relatively low.},

Quercetin also displays a different UV-protective effect depending on its location in the membranes, as the effect is more pronounced at pH 8.4 when it is located at the membrane surface. The results suggest that quercetin induces structural changes in thylakoid membranes, one of the possible reasons for its protection of the photosynthetic apparatus.},

abstract = {Ligninolytic activity in the white-rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium was previously found not to be induced by lignin, but to develop in cultures in response to nitrogen starvation. Added NH 4 + suppressed existing activity. The present study examined amino acid profiles and protein concentrations during onset of ligninolytic activity (synthetic 14C-lignin→14CO2) in nitrogen-limited cultures, and defined some characteristics of subsequent suppression by added nutrient nitrogen. During the transition between depletion of medium nitrogen and the onset of ligninolytic activity, total free intracellular amino acids increased, then rapidly decreased; changes in glutamate concentration played a major role. Intracellular protein concentration fluctuated in a manner roughly converse to that of the concentration of free amino acids. Protein turnover was rapid (5–7{\%}/h) during the transition period. Glutamate, glutamine, and histidine were the most effective of 14 nitrogenous compounds in suppressing ligninolytic activity after its onset. The suppressive effect was not mediated through carbon (glucose)-catabolite repression or by alterations in culture pH. Activities responsible for oxidation of lignin and the ligninrelated phenol, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyacetophenone, responded similarly to added nitrogen. Synthesis of a secondary metabolite, veratryl alcohol, like lignin oxidation, was suppressed quite sharply by glutamate and significantly by NH 4 + . Results indicate that nitrogen metabolism affects ligninolytic activity as a part of secondary metabolism, and suggest a role for glutamate metabolism in regulating this phase of culture development.},

abstract = {Based on enzyme activity assays and metabolic responses to waterlogging of the legume Lotus japonicus, it was previously suggested that, during hypoxia, the tricarboxylic acid cycle switches to a noncyclic operation mode. Hypotheses were postulated to explain the alternative metabolic pathways involved, but as yet, a direct analysis of the relative redistribution of label through the corresponding pathways was not made. Here, we describe the use of stable isotope-labeling experiments for studying metabolism under hypoxia using wild-type roots of the crop legume soybean (Glycine max). [13C]Pyruvate labeling was performed to compare metabolism through the tricarboxylic acid cycle, fermentation, alanine metabolism, and the $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid shunt, while [13C]glutamate and [15N]ammonium labeling were performed to address the metabolism via glutamate to succinate. Following these labelings, the time course for the redistribution of the 13C/15N label throughout the metabolic network was evaluated with gas chromatography-time of flight-mass spectrometry. Our combined labeling data suggest the inhibition of the tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme succinate dehydrogenase, also known as complex II of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, providing support for the bifurcation of the cycle and the down-regulation of the rate of respiration measured during hypoxic stress. Moreover, up-regulation of the $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid shunt and alanine metabolism explained the accumulation of succinate and alanine during hypoxia.},

@article{huante_responses_1997,
abstract = {We evaluated the responses in growth, biomass allocation, photosynthesis and stomatal conductance, to changes in light in woody seedlings from the tropical deciduous forest in Mexico, which shows a highly seasonal rain pattern. We studied ten species, which differed by 30-fold in relative growth rate (RGR). We analyzed plant growth in two contrasting light levels during 52 days and two transfers: from high to low (HL) and from low to high (LH) light intensity, and the respective controls in high (HH) and low (LL) light for another 52 days. The photosynthetic capacity (A max) and stomatal conductance were measured at the day of the transfer between light conditions and at the end of the experiment. Species with high RGR showed the largest changes in RGR in response to contrasting light conditions (HH/LL ratio), and species with low RGR showed low responses. The fast-growing species were the most plastic, followed by species with intermediate growth rates, with the slow-growing species being the least plastic. Fast-growing species achieved higher maximum photosynthetic capacities (A max) and stomatal conductance and higher response to light than slow-growing species. Species with high RGR showed a low RGR HH/LH ratio, suggesting a large response of L plants when transfered to H. The RGR of the species were associated with species specific leaf area and with the response in the leaf area, net assimilation rate and leaf weight ratio, suggesting the importance of the leaf area produced and the leaf characteristics rather than root:shoot ratio in determining RGR. Considering that seed germination is expected at the beginning of the rainy period, seedlings of most of the species will experience high-light conditions during its early growth. There are large annual variations in the time required for canopy closure (35–75 days). The influence of these variations may have different effect on the species studied. Species with intermediate growth rate and intermediate response to light changes were less affected by light reduction than fast-growing species. The intermediate-RGR species Caesalpiniaeriostachys is the most abundant and widely distributed species, perhaps this could be in part due to its ability to acclimate to both light increases and decreases. The fast-growing species studied here can be found in open sites in the forest and in areas cleared for pasture growth. These fast-growing species eventually reach the canopy, although this may require several canopy openings during their lives, which implies juvenile shade tolerance. In the tropical deciduous forest juvenile pioneer trees also benefit from the temporary high light available caused by the dry period during the rainy season. The slow-growing species Celaenodendronmexicanum forms small patches of monospecific forest; the adult trees are not completely deciduous, and they retain their old leaves for a long time period before shedding. Thus seedlings of this species may receive lower levels of light, in agreement with its shade tolerance and its lower response to light increases.},

The main objectives of this study were to (i) assess genotype × environment (GE) interaction for grain yield in rainfed durum wheat and to (ii) analyse the relationships of GE interaction with genotypic/meteorological variables by the additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) model. Grain yield and some related traits were evaluated in 25 durum wheat genotypes (landrace, breeding line, old and new varieties) in 12 rainfed environments differing in winter air temperature. The AMMI analysis of variance indicated that the environment had highest contribution (84.3{\%} of total variation) to the variation in grain yield. The first interaction principal component axis (IPCA1) explained 77.5{\%} of GE interaction sum of squares (SS), and its effect was 5.5 times greater than the genotype effect, indicating that the IPCA1 contributed remarkably to the total GE interaction. Large GE interaction for grain yield was detected, indicating specific adaptation of genotypes. While the postdictive success method indicated AMMI-4 as the best model, the predictive success one suggested AMMI-1. The AMMI biplot analysis confirmed a rank change interaction among the locations, indicating the presence of strong and unpredictable rank-change location-by-year interactions for locations. In contrast to landraces and old varieties, the breeding lines with high yield performance had high phenotypic plasticity under varying environmental conditions. Results indicated that the GE interaction was associated with the interaction of heading date, plant height, rainfall, air temperature and freezing days. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The geminivirus complex known as cassava mosaic disease (CMD) is one of the most devastating viruses for cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz). The aim of this study was to use molecular-assisted selection (MAS) to identify CMD-resistant accessions and ascertain promising crosses with elite Brazilian varieties. One thousand two hundred twenty-four accessions were genotyped using five molecular markers (NS169, NS158, SSRY028, SSRY040 and RME1) that were associated with resistance to CMD, along with 402 SNPs (single-nucleotide polymorphism). The promising crosses were identified using a discriminant analysis of main component (DAPC), and the matrix of genomic relationship was estimated with SNP markers. The CMD1 gene, previously described in M. glaziovii, was not found in M. esculenta. In contrast, the CMD2 gene was found in 5, 4 and 5 {\%} of cassava accessions, with flanking markers NS169+RME1, NS158+RME1 and SSRY28+RME1, respectively. Only seven accessions presented all markers linked to the CMD resistance. The DAPC of the seven accessions along with 17 elite cassava varieties led to the formation of three divergent clusters. Potential sources of resistance to CMD were divided into two groups, while the elite varieties were distributed into three groups. The low estimates of the genomic relationship (ranging from -0.167 to 0.681 with an average of 0.076) contributed to the success in identifying contrasting genotypes. The use of MAS in countries where CMD is a quarantine disease constitutes a successful strategy not only for identifying the resistant accessions but also for determining the promising crosses.Key words: Manihot esculenta; breeding; disease; virus},

Reliable estimates of QTL main effects (additive and epistasis effects) can be obtained by the maximum-likelihood estimation method, while QE interaction effects (additive×environment interaction and epistasis×environment interaction) can be predicted by the-best-linear-unbiased-prediction (BLUP) method. Likelihood ratio and t statistics were combined for testing hypotheses about QTL effects and QE interactions. Monte Carlo simulations were conducted for evaluating the unbiasedness, accuracy, and power for parameter estimation in QTL mapping. The results indicated that the mixed-model approaches could provide unbiased estimates for both positions and effects of QTLs, as well as unbiased predicted values for QE interactions. Additionally, the mixed-model approaches also showed high accuracy and power in mapping QTLs with epistatic effects and QE interactions. Based on the models and the methodology, a computer software program (QTLMapper version 1.0) was developed, which is suitable for interval mapping of QTLs with additive, additive×additive epistasis, and their environment interactions.},

abstract = {Traditional perennial ryegrass–white clover mixtures have limitations in combined productivity and quality that herbs like chicory may alleviate. This study examined the consequences on productivity and quality of as well as competition and facilitation after introducing chicory into varies ryegrass–legume-based pastures in a field study over three consecutive growing seasons. A cultivar of chicory, suitable for grazing, in pure stand was found to out-yield a pure stand ryegrass in terms of dry matter and nitrogen (N) accumulation but was found to yield similar to mixtures of chicory and ryegrass. The inclusion of chicory, increased N accumulation per area unit irrespective of associated leguminous species but had no effect (P {\textgreater} 0.05) on the combined dry matter yield of these mixtures as compared to the chicory–ryegrass mixture. Chicory was not found to co-exist well with associated fodder legumes but it co-existed well with perennial ryegrass. Determined by a direct 15N plant labelling technique, chicory transferred little N to associated legumes and under moderate soil N conditions it almost out-competed the white clover whereas lucerne was able to withstand the competition with birdsfoot trefoil as intermediate. Chicory and ryegrass did exchange N amounting to less than 5{\%} of the receiver plants' N economy whereas the N transfer from the N-rich lucerne constituted 15{\%} of the associated ryegrass' N economy but less (P {\textless} 0.05) of the chicory's N economy. These differences are ascribed to the species' root morphology and root zonation. Chicory accumulated large amounts of calcium, potassium, sodium and zinc but significant less of magnesium and manganese, irrespective of the N supply. In the case of sodium it was a short-term effect whereas calcium and possibly also sulphur, copper and zinc accumulation increased over time. It is concluded that chicory may improve the management of intensive dairy farms with a large N surplus because of the increase in productivity per unit area and N uptake efficiency and add significant improvements of the quality of the forage.},

abstract = {Growth and cellular differentiation follow a basipetal course in the next to the last internode (p-1 internode) in Avena sativa L. During internodal extension, intercalary-meristem activity becomes localized to the base and peripheral portion of the internode with predominant cytokinetic activity occurring in the lower portions of the epidermal and outer ground-parenchyma systems. The intercalary meristem in the p-1 internode of Avena consists of parallel rows of more or less isodiametric initials which give rise to more differentiated elements both above and below the intercalary-meristem zone. Cytokinetic activity in the intercalary meristem is continuous; that is, no evidence of a diurnal rhythm in frequency of mitoses was found. Below the intercalary meristem, only long epidermal cells differentiate from the meristem. In these cells the nuclei become remarkably elongate and corkscrew-shaped; these are considered to be senescent nuclei. Cellular differentiation above the intercalary meristem is continuously basipetal and results in formation of a remarkably ordered series of long epidermal cells which alternate with pairs of cork and silica cells, trichomes, or stomates. The earliest stages of cytodifferentiation of these epidermal idioblasts and the long epidermal cells can be seen in the intercalary meristem and just above it. Changes and rates of change in cell number and cell length have been analyzed for different stages in the development of the p-1 internode. Cell division continues until p-1i is 3-4 cm in length; then the cell-division component of intercalary-meristem activity ceases to be of any significance. Cell division and cell elongation are clearly overlapping processes during the earliest stages of internodal development. Most of the linear extension of p-1 internode in Avena, however, is explained on the basis of growth by cell elongation.},

Conventional method included the use of Berzelius beakers and Gooch-crucibles, as well as refluxing and filtration apparatus. For aNDF analysis, all autoclave methods showed high level of precision as indicated by low standard deviation (S.D.) from regressions (mean of 40.4 g aNDF/kg dry matter). Slope of the regression for autoclave treatment at 110 °C during 60 min, however, differed from 1 (P{\textless}0.05). Autoclaving treatment at 110 °C during 40 min had the lowest (24.1 g aNDF/kg dry matter) and at 120 °C during 60 min had the highest (75.6 g aNDF/kg dry matter) bias. For ADF analysis, although the level of precision of regressions for all treatments was relatively high (S.D. mean of 34.5 g ADF/kg dry matter), the slope of regression did not differ from 1 only for 110 °C during 40 min treatment. Moreover, bias using this treatment was near 0 while it varied from 73 to 174 g ADF/kg dry matter using the others autoclave treatments. In conclusion, aNDF and ADF analysis in forage and concentrate feedstuffs may be carried out simultaneously in an autoclave and not biased from Gooch-crucible conventional method, using filter bags and a temperature of 110 °C for 40 min.},

abstract = {In order to determine stable bread wheat genotypes with high grain yield via a single parameter, field experiments were conducted with 20 genotypes for 4 consecutive years in two different conditions (irrigated and rainfed) in a completely randomized block design with three replications in each environment. Combined analysis of variance showed highly significant differences for the GE interaction indicating the possibility of selection for stable entries. The results of additive main effect and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) analysis revealed 10{\%} of total variability was justified by the GE interaction which was 2.5 times more than that of genotypes. Ordination techniques displayed high differences for the interaction principal components (IPC1, IPC2 and IPC3), exhibiting that 83{\%} of the GE sum of squares was justified by AMMI1, AMMI2 and AMMI3, i.e., 3.77 times more than that explained by the linear regression model displaying the relative efficiency of AMMI1 model in comparison with regression model. AMMI stability value (ASV) discriminated genotypes G6, G9, G14, G15, G17 and G18 as the stable entries. As stability per se is not a desirable selection criterion, because the most stable genotypes would not necessarily give the best yield performance, hence, simultaneous consideration of grain yield and ASV in a single non-parametric index entitled: Genotype Selection Index (GSI), discriminated G6 and G17 with general adaptability and high grain yield for rainfed and irrigated conditions which was in agreement with the results of biplot analysis.},

abstract = {The identification and recommendation of superior genotypes is crucial for the growth of industrial crops, and sugarcane breeding performs a vital role by developing more productive cultivars. The study of genotype x environment interaction has been an essential tool in this process. Thereby, the purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between methods of adaptability and stability in sugarcane. Data were collected from trials using a randomized block design with three repetitions and 15 clones of sugarcane in nine environments in the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Methodologies based on analysis of variance, linear regression, multivariate analysis, nonparametric statistics, and mixed model were used. The methods of Lin and Binns, Annicchiarico, and harmonic mean of relative performance of genotypic values (MHPRVG) were similar in their classification of genotypes. The additive main effect and multiplicative interactions (AMMI) and Wricke methods tended to select the most stable genotypes; however, genotypes were less productive, coinciding with the stability parameter of Eberhart and Russell. The MHPRVG method is preferred over the methods of Lin and Binns and Annicchiarico because it includes the concepts of productivity, adaptability, and stability, and it provide direct genetic values of individuals. The use of the MHPRVG and Eberhart and Russell methods is recommended because the combination of these methods is complementary and leads to greater accuracy in the identification of genotypes of sugarcane for different environments.},

abstract = {Under natural conditions, the plants are, usually, surrounded by a series of potential enemies. They had created strategies of defense against pathogens and herbivores{\&}{\#}39; attacks, allowing its perpetuation throughout evolution. These defense mechanisms are closely associated with the synthesis of secondary metabolites, which are also worldwide used in several areas of industry. This bibliographic review was conducted aiming to better understand how plants synthesize these substances in response to biotic or abiotic stimuli. The results discussed here revealed that synthesis of plant secondary metabolites is dependent on changes in several metabolic pathways, being often directly associated with the primary metabolism. Injury by herbivores or pathogens, temperature, CO2 levels, solar radiation and drought, are the factors related to the environment that express the most significant signs of inhibition or synthesis of plant secondary metabolites. Global climatic changes recently observed can affect the metabolic pathways network and, consequently, secondary metabolites synthesis. Nowadays, genomic tools have been useful alternatives that are leading to a new revolution of plant breeding, allowing the overexpression or inhibition of these substances. Some limitations and challenges to be achieved upon the dynamics of secondary metabolite synthesis in plants are presented. Key words: Jasmonic acid, transcription factors, inhibition, synthesis.},

In addition to the requirements of water for germination, seeds of legumes used for human consumption require hydration to prepare them for cooking. The site of water entry, however, and its movement during imbibition in legumes and particularly in soybean is still not clear. One of the best and most precise methods of tracing water movement in plant tissue is nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging. In our study, we applied NMR imaging to reveal the water distribution in soybean seeds during the first 24 h of hydration. It has been found that hydration during this period is a multistage process. Water enters the seed through the micropyle and hilum and the concentration of water there is very high during the entire imbibition process. Inside the seed, water first fills the voids between cotyledons, and between the cotyledons and the seed coat. Water then enters the embryonic axis, and from it, is distributed...},

abstract = {Pungency owing to the presence of capsaicinoids is a unique character of pepper (Capsicum spp.). Capsaicinoids are produced in the placenta and it has long been known that a single dominant gene, C, is required for pungent genotypes to produce capsaicinoids. We mapped C to pepper chromosome 2 in a cross between a pungent Capsicum frutescens wild accession and a non-pungent Capsicum annuum bell pepper. This position confirmed results from earlier studies. The RFLP marker TG 205 cosegregated with C and two additional RFLP markers were also located within 1 cM. The recessive allele at the C locus is used in breeding programs around the world focused on very diverse germplasm, hence any of these tightly linked markers may be of value as potential sources of useful markers for marker-assisted selection. To demonstrate this point, we developed a PCR-based CAPS (cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence) marker linked to C using the sequence of the Capsicum fibrillin gene located 0.4 cM from C. The use of molecular markers for high-throughput screening for the c allele in pepper breeding programs is discussed.},

abstract = {Research on the relationships between the protein content and the quality characteristics of 70 wheat cultivars was carried out by analysing the high molecular weight (HMW) subunits of glutenin by Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS-PAGE). The quantity of protein in each of the bands was determined by densitometry. Simple correlations were calculated between the proportion of each of the HMW glutenin subunits and various flour quality characteristics as measured by the Chopin Alveograph which gives strength (W), tenacity (P), swelling (G) and extensibility (L), the Zeleny sedimentation test (Zy) and the Pelshenke swelling test (Pe). All of the characteristics were correlated with at least 4 subunits. Subunits 6 and 8 were the only subunits not correlated significantly with at least one of the characteristics. The parameters W, P, Zy and Pe were correlated positively with bands 5 and 10 and negatively with bands 2 and 12. Subunit 9 was correlated positively with W, P and Zy. Subunits 1 and 2* were correlated positively with G and W, respectively. Elimination of the influence of grain protein content in the variation of the tests from one cultivar to another did not change the sign or significance of the correlations observed. Moreover, if the influence of the heterogeneity of the gliadin bands were eliminated, most of the correlations with tenacity, swelling and extensibility criteria disappeared. Only subunits 17 and 18 remained favourably correlated with swelling. This suggests that gliadins and HMW glutenin subunits interact in producing the rheological characteristics of the dough.},

abstract = {When Pinus taeda cell suspension cultures are exposed to 8{\%} sucrose solution, the cells undergo significant intracellular disruption, irregular wall thickening/lignification with concomitant formation of an ‘extracellular lignin' precipitate. However, addition of potassium iodide (KI), an H2O2 scavenger, inhibits this lignification response, while the ability to synthesize the monolignols, p-coumaryl and coniferyl alcohols, is retained. Lignin synthesis (i.e. polymerization) is thus temporarily correlated with H2O2 generation, strongly implying a regulatory role for the latter. Time course analyses of extracellular metabolites leading up to polymer formation reveal that coniferyl alcohol, but not p-coumaryl alcohol, undergoes substantial coupling reactions to give various lignans. Of these, the metabolites, dihydrodehydrodiconiferyl alcohol, shonanin (divanillyl tetrahydrofuran) and its apparent aryl tetralin derivative, cannot be explained simply on the basis of phenolic coupling. It is proposed that these moieties are the precursors of socalled reduced substructures in the lignin macromolecule. This adds a new perspective to the lignin assembly mechanism.},

@book{Stroup2013,
abstract = {"Generalized Linear Mixed Models: Modern Concepts, Methods and Applications presents an introduction to linear modeling using the generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) as an overarching conceptual framework. For readers new to linear models, the book helps them see the big picture. It shows how linear models fit with the rest of the core statistics curriculum and points out the major issues that statistical modelers must consider. Along with describing common applications of GLMMs, the text introduces the essential theory and main methodology associated with linear models that accommodate random model effects and non-Gaussian data. Unlike traditional linear model textbooks that focus on normally distributed data, this one adopts a generalized mixed model approach throughout: data for linear modeling need not be normally distributed and effects may be fixed or random. With numerous examples using SAS{\textregistered} PROC GLIMMIX, this book is ideal for graduate students in statistics, statistics professionals seeking to update their knowledge, and researchers new to the generalized linear model thought process. It focuses on data-driven processes and provides context for extending traditional linear model thinking to generalized linear mixed modeling"-- Part I: The Big Picture -- 1. Modeling Basics -- 2.

abstract = {Alllelopathic potential of chicory was investigated by evaluating its effect on seed germination, soluble sugar, malondialdehyde (MDA) and the chlorophyll content of three target plants species (Festuca arundinacea, Trifolium repens and Medicago sativa). The secretion of allelochemicals was regulated by keeping the donor plant (chicory) separate from the three target plant species and using different pH and nitrogen levels. Leachates from donor pots with different pH levels and nitrogen concentrations continuously irrigated the target pots containing the seedlings. The allelopathic effects of the chicory at equivalent coupling of nitrogen supply and pH level on the three target plants species were explored via models analyses. The results suggested a positive effect of nitrogen supply and pH level on allelochemical secretion from chicory plants. The nitrogen supply and pH level were located at a rectangular area defined by 149 to 168 mg/l nitrogen supply combining 4.95 to 7.0 pH value and point located at nitrogen supply 177 mg/l, pH 6.33 when they were in equivalent coupling effects; whereas the inhibitory effects of equivalent coupling nitrogen supply and pH level were located at rectangular area defined by 125 to 131 mg/l nitrogen supply combining 6.71 to 6.88 pH value and two points respectively located at nitrogen supply 180 mg/l with pH 6.38 and nitrogen supply 166 mg/l with pH 7.59. Aqueous extracts of chicory fleshy roots and leaves accompanied by treatment at different sand pH values and nitrogen concentrations influenced germination, seedling growth, soluble sugar, MDA and chlorophyll of F. arundinacea, T. repens and M. sativa. Additionally, we determined the phenolics contents of root and leaf aqueous extracts, which were 0.104{\%} and 0.044{\%} on average, respectively.},

The aim is to weight the feasibility and opportunity of such device in our semi–arid region (Batna city), in order to promote an academic prototype and hence launch production project as startup linked to our laboratory. Therefore, the geometrical configuration involved in this work is conceived on the basis of literature survey especially experimental researches. Furthermore, an analysis has been performed to reach a well zero dimensional (0D) adapted mathematical model based on mass and energy balance as a first step, before launching tridimensional (3D) CFD study under ANSYS–FLUENT software. In this situation, a computer code in FORTRAN language has been elaborated to treat both the explicit effect of thermal radiation term $\sigma$ A s $\epsilon$ ( T s 4 − T c 4 ) on temperature and distillate mass productivity, and then the performance of such system in Batna climate conditions (a graphical interface was created to plot and to analysis all quantity especially solar radiation). After a thorough assessment, it is shown that the order of magnitude of the radiation term is 3.23{\%} in the hot stage, which represents a low contribution in energy balance equations. On other hand, the curves tendencies of the main fields and the amount of the day mass production are encouraging and show a good agreement with available literature.},

abstract = {Objective Synthesizing research on social cognitive theories applied to health behavior is an important step in the development of an evidence base of psychological factors as targets for effective behavioral interventions. However, few meta-analyses of research on social cognitive theories in health contexts have conducted simultaneous tests of theoretically-stipulated pattern effects using path analysis. We argue that conducting path analyses of meta-analytic effects among constructs from social cognitive theories is important to test nomological validity, account for mediation effects, and evaluate unique effects of theory constructs independent of past behavior. We illustrate our points by conducting new analyses of two meta-analyses of a popular theory applied to health behaviors, the theory of planned behavior. Method We conducted meta-analytic path analyses of the theory in two behavioral contexts (alcohol and dietary behaviors) using data from the primary studies included in the original meta-analyses augmented to include intercorrelations among constructs and relations with past behavior missing from the original analysis. Results Findings supported the nomological validity of the theory and its hypotheses for both behaviors, confirmed important model processes through mediation analysis, demonstrated the attenuating effect of past behavior on theory relations, and provided estimates of the unique effects of theory constructs independent of past behavior. Conclusions Our analysis illustrates the importance of conducting a simultaneous test of theory-stipulated effects in meta-analyses of social cognitive theories applied to health behavior. We recommend researchers adopt this analytic procedure when synthesizing evidence across primary tests of social cognitive theories in health.},

A total of 39 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and 74 epistatic interactions were confirmed in 2011 and 2012. All QTLs detected in 2011 showed greater than 10 {\%} phenotypic variation (10.21–50.3 {\%}). In 2012, 19 of 23 QTLs showed phenotypic variation greater than 10 {\%} (6.46–93.71 {\%}). Among all QTLs detected, qAC9 had the highest phenotypic variance (93.71 {\%}). Additionally, qEH4, qSEL6, and q100KW10 were stably expressed. These QTLs had higher phenotypic variance and were observed in both years; therefore, they may be considered major QTLs. Some new QTLs identified in this study were located on different loci compared with other studies. The genetic region (bin 4.08) strongly controls plant height and ear height, and results from pleiotropy and/or tight linkage. qST3 and qEH3 were co-located within two common adjacent simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers (umc2275 and umc1273), whereas qEL6 and qSEL6 were co-located within two common adjacent SSR markers (umc2309 and bnlg238). The QTLs related to kernel quality traits, qWC4 (water content) was tightly linked to the gene bt2 (brittle endosperm 2) and qAC9 (amylose content) located between the flanking markers umc1634 and wx1 (waxy1). Thus, these SSR markers are a useful selection tool for screening grain yield and yield component traits.},

The study was carried out in an area of 60.5 ha within a seed production field, where a sampling grid of 1 point per hectare was generated. In each sampling point, the soil resistance to penetration was determined and the size and physiological quality of seeds produced was assessed by germination and vigour tests. Maps of soil resistance to penetration, productivity, seed size and seed physiological quality were interpolated from the point data and correlation analysis of variables performed. Soil compaction negatively affects productivity, size and physiological quality of soybean seeds. Spatial variability for all assessed characteristics was detected and a minimum interdependence of 200 m was established.},

According to our results the standard t test approach does offer generally reasonable performance even when the underlying distribution departs from bivariate normality. However, for non-normal data alternative techniques, especially the permutation test and using the RIN (rank-based inverse normal) transformation, offer better control of type I error and good power. With regard to confidence intervals, all investigated methods perform similarly; and there is no consistent pattern with which to strongly recommend one method over another.

abstract = {The draft genome of the pear (Pyrus bretschneideri) using a combination of BAC-by-BAC and next-generation sequencing is reported. A 512.0-Mb sequence corresponding to 97.1{\%} of the estimated genome size of this highly heterozygous species is assembled with 194× coverage. High-density genetic maps comprising 2005 SNP markers anchored 75.5{\%} of the sequence to all 17 chromosomes. The pear genome encodes 42,812 protein-coding genes, and of these, ∼28.5{\%} encode multiple isoforms. Repetitive sequences of 271.9 Mb in length, accounting for 53.1{\%} of the pear genome, are identified. Simulation of eudicots to the ancestor of Rosaceae has reconstructed nine ancestral chromosomes. Pear and apple diverged from each other ∼5.4–21.5 million years ago, and a recent whole-genome duplication (WGD) event must have occurred 30–45 MYA prior to their divergence, but following divergence from strawberry. When compared with the apple genome sequence, size differences between the apple and pear genomes are confirmed mainly due to the presence of repetitive sequences predominantly contributed by transposable elements (TEs), while genic regions are similar in both species. Genes critical for self-incompatibility, lignified stone cells (a unique feature of pear fruit), sorbitol metabolism, and volatile compounds of fruit have also been identified. Multiple candidate SFB genes appear as tandem repeats in the S-locus region of pear; while lignin synthesis-related gene family expansion and highly expressed gene families of HCT, C3′H, and CCOMT contribute to high accumulation of both G-lignin and S-lignin. Moreover, alpha-linolenic acid metabolism is a key pathway for aroma in pear fruit.},

They are generally defined by the occurrence of a nitrogen atom in an oxidative state within a heterocyclic ring. Homologues for many enzymes involved in alkaloid biosynthesis have been detected in the Arabidopsis genome, in spite of the apparent lack of complex alkaloids in this plant. The most common homologues are putative genes encoding decorative enzymes such as hydroxylases, methyltransferases and acetyltransferases. Nevertheless, the recent discovery that Arabidopsis produces volatile terpenoids, coupled with the multitude of alkaloid biosynthetic gene homologues, lends credibility to the suggestion that undiscovered alkaloids are also present in this plant.},

abstract = {This research was carried out to study stability analysis and comparison between some measures of stability from AMMI model in 17 chickpea genotypes, in RCBD with four replications in five different research stations of Iran across two years (2004-2005). Spearman's rank correlation was used to measure the relationship between measures of stability from AMMI model. To understand better relationships among these methods, principal component analysis, was performed. The first two PCs explained 87.65{\%} of the variance of original variables. The relationships among the different stability statistics from AMMI model are graphically displayed in a biplot of PC1 and PC2. The results also revealed that stability measures can be classified into three groups. The first group included, SIPC4, EV4, MASV, Dz4, AV (AMGE), Wi(AMMI) and FAi which were correlated with mean yield. The second group consists of ASV, Da4, Bi and Za4 which were correlated with mean yield too. Group 3 consist of FPi that was not associated with the more stability methods and mean yield. This measure may not be as good as the other methods. The results of the correlation matrix and the PC analysis between different measures of stability from AMMI model showed that all measures (except for FPi) can be used for evaluating the responses of chickpea genotypes to changing environments. Eventually, according to all measures of stability from AMMI model (except for FPi) and regarding the high mean yield, genotype G13 (FLIP 97-114) was recommended for national release in Iran, as it adequately demonstrated wide adaptation across environments.},

abstract = {The maize genome contains extensive chromosomal duplications that probably were produced by an ancient tetraploid event. Comparative cereal maps have identified at least 10 duplicated, or homologous, chromosomal regions within maize. However, the methods used to document chromosomal homologies from comparative maps are not statistical, and their criteria are often unclear. This paper describes the development of a simulation method to test for the statistical significance of marker colinearity between chromosomes, and the application of the method to a molecular map of maize. The method documents colinearity among 24 pairs of maize chromosomes, suggesting homology in maize is more complex than represented by comparative cereal maps. The results also reveal that 60{\%}–82{\%} of the genome has been retained in colinear regions and that as much as a third of the genome could be present in multiple copies. Altogether, the complex pattern of colinearity among maize chromosomes suggests that current comparative cereal maps do not adequately represent the evolution and organization of the maize genome.},

abstract = {Loess Plateau of China is an area with serious soil evaporation and large inter-annual rainfall variations. Water stress is the major limiting factor for crop production in local area. Optimizing plant density is one crucial management in semi-arid dry land areas where crop growth is constrained by precipitation and a high evaporative demand. The Agricultural Production System Simulator (APSIM) was parameterized and tested with two years datasets, and then used to investigate long-term rainfed maize productivity and water balance with the historical weather records. Model application showed that water use and yield were varied because of the plant density and the inter-annual variability of precipitation. Plant density presented no influence on the evapotranspiration (ET) in extremely dry years, dry years and mild wet years but a significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) influence in normal and extremely wet years. In extremely dry years, the grain yield and (WUE) were all significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) decreased when plant density increased. The grain yield and WUE showed a parabolic relation with the plant density except extremely dry years. On average, the maximum yield and WUE were 6715 kg ha−1 and 1.81 kg m−3 at 52500 plants ha−1 (D2) in dry years, 7857 kg ha−1 and 1.92 kg m−3 at 67500 plants ha−1 (D3) in normal years, 8937 kg ha−1 and 2.19 kg m−3 at 67500 plants ha−1 (D3) in mild wet years，and 9713 kg ha−1 at 82500 plants ha−1 (D4) and 2.25 kg m−3 at 67500 plants ha−1 (D3) in extremely wet years, respectively. However, no significant difference was obtained for average yield or WUE when compared traditional density of 52500 plants ha−1 (D2) with higher plant density. Compared with the traditional plant density of 52500 plants ha−1 (D2), the increase of plant density significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) reduced soil evaporation, only with the exception of extremely dry years. In order to get long term average benefits in the study area and similar agro-ecological zones, plant populations should not exceed 32500 plants ha−1 (D1) in extremely dry years, indeed, lower may be better. A plant density of 52500 plants ha−1 (D2) in dry years and 67500 plants ha−1 (D3) in normal years, mild wet years and extremely wet years are recommended as the optimum value, respectively.},

A greenhouse experiment was designed to study the expression patterns of five genes (TaGS1c; TaGS2a; TaAlaAT; TaASN1 and TaPPDK) involved in N metabolism in two wheat genotypes with high and low NUtEs. N-efficient (YM18) and N-inefficient (XY6) wheat genotypes were planted at low N (no N application) and high N (0.3 g N kg−1 soil) treatments. Shoots were sampled at the F3 (tillering), F7 (jointing), F10 (heading) and F11 (grain filling) stages, and expression of the five genes was quantified using real-time, reverse transcription PCR (polymerase chain reaction). The higher grain NUtE of YM18 compared to XY6 was attributed to its higher N remobilization efficiency. The expression of the five genes showed significant seasonal dynamics, and expression of genes TaGS1c, TaAlaAT and TaPPDK in YM18 increased significantly and were higher than that in XY6 at reproductive growth under either low or high N treatments. These genes may contribute to the high N remobilization efficiency of YM18 and serve as potential targets to enhance NUtE of wheat.},

While detailed regional accounts of the effects of extreme weather disasters exist, the global scale effects of droughts, floods and extreme temperature on crop production are yet to be quantified. Here we estimate for the first time, to our knowledge, national cereal production losses across the globe resulting from reported extreme weather disasters during 1964–2007. We show that droughts and extreme heat significantly reduced national cereal production by 9–10{\%}, whereas our analysis could not identify an effect from floods and extreme cold in the national data. Analysing the underlying processes, we find that production losses due to droughts were associated with a reduction in both harvested area and yields, whereas extreme heat mainly decreased cereal yields. Furthermore, the results highlight {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}7{\%} greater production damage from more recent droughts and 8–11{\%} more damage in developed countries than in developing ones. Our findings may help to guide agricultural priorities in international disaster risk reduction and adaptation efforts.},

@article{lemoine_source--sink_2013,
abstract = {Source-to-sink transport of sugar is one of the major determinants of plant growth and relies on the efficient and controlled distribution of sucrose (and some other sugars such as raffinose and polyols) across plant organs through the phloem. However, sugar transport through the phloem can be affected by many environmental factors that alter source/sink relationships. In this paper, we summarize current knowledge about the phloem transport mechanisms and review the effects of several abiotic (water and salt stress, mineral deficiency, CO2, light, temperature, air, and soil pollutants) and biotic (mutualistic and pathogenic microbes, viruses, aphids, and parasitic plants) factors. Concerning abiotic constraints, alteration of the distribution of sugar among sinks is often reported, with some sinks as roots favored in case of mineral deficiency. Many of these constraints impair the transport function of the phloem but the exact mechanisms are far from being completely known. Phloem integrity can be disrupted (e.g., by callose deposition) and under certain conditions, phloem transport is affected, earlier than photosynthesis. Photosynthesis inhibition could result from the increase in sugar concentration due to phloem transport decrease. Biotic interactions (aphids, fungi, viruses{\ldots}) also affect crop plant productivity. Recent breakthroughs have identified some of the sugar transporters involved in these interactions on the host and pathogen sides. The different data are discussed in relation to the phloem transport pathways. When possible, the link with current knowledge on the pathways at the molecular level will be highlighted.},

@article{li_jasmonic_2014,
abstract = {Anthocyanins are critical for plants. It is shown that the expression of genes encoding the key enzymes such as dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR), UDP-Glc: flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase (UF3GT), and leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase (LDOX) in anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway is regulated by MYB75, a R2R3 MYB transcription factor. The production of anthocyanin is known to be promoted by jasmonic acid (JA) in light but not in darkness. The photoreceptors cryptochrome 1 (CRY1), phytochrome B (phyB), and phytochrome A (phyA) are also shown to mediate light promotion of anthocyanin accumulation, respectively, whereas their downstream factor COP1, a master negative regulator of photomorphogensis, represses anthocyanin accumulation. However, whether JA coordinates with photoreceptors in the regulation of anthocyanin accumulation is unknown. Here, we show that under far-red light, JA promotes anthocyanin accumulation in a phyA signaling pathway-dependent manner. The phyA mutant is hyposensitive to jasmonic acid analog methyl jasmonic acid (MeJA) under far-red light. The dominant mutant of MYB75, pap1-D, accumulates significantly higher levels of anthocyanin than wild type under far-red light, whereas knockdown of MYBs (MYB75, MYB90, MYB113, and MYB114) through RNAi significantly reduces MeJA promotion of anthocyanin accumulation. The phyA pap1-D double mutant shows reduced responsiveness to MeJA, similar to phyA mutant under far-red light. In darkness, a mutant allele of cop1, cop1–4, shows enhanced responsiveness to MeJA, but pap1-D mutant is barely responsive to MeJA. Upon MeJA application, the cop1–4 pap1-D double mutant accumulates considerably higher levels of anthocyanin than cop1–4 in darkness. Protein studies indicate that MYB75 protein is stabilized by white light and far-red light. Further gene expression studies suggest that MeJA promotes the expression of DFR, UF3GT, and LDOX genes in a phyA- and MYB75-dependent manner under far-red light. Our findings suggest that JA promotion of anthocyanin accumulation under far-red light is dependent on phyA signaling pathway, consisting of phyA, COP1, and MYB75.},

abstract = {Crop improvement and the dissection of complex genetic traits require germplasm diversity. Although this necessary phenotypic variability exists in diverse maize, most research is conducted using a small subset of inbred lines. An association population of 302 lines is now available – a valuable research tool that captures a large proportion of the alleles in cultivated maize. Provided that appropriate statistical models correcting for population structure are included, this tool can be used in association analyses to provide high-resolution evaluation of multiple alleles. This study describes the population structure of the 302 lines, and investigates the relationship between population structure and various measures of phenotypic and breeding value. On average, our estimates of population structure account for 9.3{\%} of phenotypic variation, roughly equivalent to a major quantitative trait locus (QTL), with a high of 35{\%}. Inclusion of population structure in association models is critical to meaningful analyses. This new association population has the potential to identify QTL with small effects, which will aid in dissecting complex traits and in planning future projects to exploit the rich diversity present in maize.},

abstract = {Some traditional medicinal practitioners believe that cultivated medicinal plants will lose healing powers, compared to plants growing in nature. Several scientists have shown that a plant under stress will produce secondary metabolites that may influence its medicinal properties. This perception has negative effects on the cultivation of medicinal plants to control local extinctions by uncontrolled collection of medicinal plants. To investigate this perception we examined the effect of water treatments on the antimicrobial activity of selected plant species grown under controlled conditions. Firstly, Tulbaghia violacea and Hypoxis hemerocallidea plants were subjected to watering regimes of 1000 ml of water in intervals of 3,14 and 21 days in a preliminary experiment. Subsequently, T. violacea, Leonotis dysophylla and Bulbine frutescens were subjected to different water regimes of 50, 100, 200 and 500 ml every second day for 240 days. Air-dried leaves of matured plants were finely ground and extracted with acetone. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and total activity were determined in order to evaluate the antimicrobial activity and potential use of plant extracts against four bacteria and two fungi. In general there were no statistically significant differences in MIC and total activity values and there were no clear trends across treatments. The applied water treatments did not cause significant effects on the antimicrobial activity of extracts. The fact that water stress did not materially influence antimicrobial activity does not mean that water stress does not affect other medicinal properties. Nevertheless our results question the general perception of traditional medicinal practitioners that plants growing under natural stress conditions have higher biological activities at least as far as water stress related to antimicrobial activities is concerned.},

@article{mitchell_bayesian_1988,
abstract = {This article is concerned with the selection of subsets of predictor variables in a linear regression model for the prediction of a dependent variable. It is based on a Bayesian approach, intended to be as objective as possible. A probability distribution is first assigned to the dependent variable through the specification of a family of prior distributions for the unknown parameters in the regression model. The method is not fully Bayesian, however, because the ultimate choice of prior distribution from this family is affected by the data. It is assumed that the predictors represent distinct observables; the corresponding regression coefficients are assigned independent prior distributions. For each regression coefficient subject to deletion from the model, the prior distribution is a mixture of a point mass at 0 and a diffuse uniform distribution elsewhere, that is, a “spike and slab” distribution. The random error component is assigned a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation $\sigma$, where ln($\sigma$) has a locally uniform noninformative prior distribution. The appropriate posterior probabilities are derived for each submodel. If the regression coefficients have identical priors, the posterior distribution depends only on the data and the parameter $\gamma$, which is the height of the spike divided by the height of the slab for the common prior distribution. This parameter is not assigned a probability distribution; instead, it is considered a parameter that indexes the members of a class of Bayesian methods. Graphical methods are proposed as informal guides for choosing $\gamma$, assessing the complexity of the response function and the strength of the individual predictor variables, and assessing the degree of uncertainty about the best submodel. The following plots against $\gamma$ are suggested: (a) posterior probability that a particular regression coefficient is 0; (b) posterior expected number of terms in the model; (c) posterior entropy of the submodel distribution; (d) posterior predictive error; and (e) posterior probability of goodness of fit. Plots (d) and (e) are suggested as ways to choose y. The predictive error is determined using a Bayesian cross-validation approach that generates a predictive density for each observation, given all of the data except that observation, that is, a type of “leave one out” approach. The goodness-of-fit measure is the sum of the posterior probabilities of all submodels that pass a standard F test for goodness of fit relative to the full model, at a specified level of significance. The dependence of the results on the scaling of the variables is discussed, and some ways to choose the scaling constants are suggested. Examples based on a large data set arising from an energy-conservation study are given to demonstrate the application of the methods.},

The counting of chloroplast number in the epidermal guard cells of stomata was used for the rapid screening of tetraploids. The differences in mean chloroplast numbers between diploid and tetraploid plants were highly significant. For all plants tested, the tetraploid genotype had almost double the number of chloroplasts per guard cell compared to the diploid origin. Some plants were further analysed by flow cytometry to verify their ploidy status that was determined by chloroplast numbers. The results of this study demonstrated for the first time that chloroplast counting in poplar and black locust could be an effective and reliable method for pre-screening large numbers of plants for their ploidy level.

The “VN1” variety (selected from “Csengődi csokros”) showed the highest antioxidant capacity. The anthocyanin content, measured by pH differential method or isolated by solid phase extraction, was the highest also in “VN1”.

The presence of malvidin-3,5-O-diglycoside was verified by MALDI-TOF MS. Sour cherry extracts and selected anthocyanins inhibited the human salivary alpha-amylase catalyzed hydrolysis competitively. The lowest IC50 value, 55 $\mu$g mL−1 or 80 $\mu$M, was measured for malvidin-3,5-O-diglycoside, for which possible binding modes within the alpha-amylase active site could be investigated in silico using molecular docking and molecular dynamics.},

The proportion of LMW glutenin subunits decreased and the proportion of gliadins increased during grain development and in response to N application. Differences were observed between the proportions of LMW glutenin subunits and gliadins in low- and high-protein grain, these two fractions being decreased and increased, respectively. There was little effect of grain protein content on the proportions of either the HMW glutenin subunits or large glutenin polymers, which are enriched in these subunits, with the latter increasing during development in all cultivars. The proportion of total protein present in polymers in the mature grain decreased with increasing N level. Correlations were also observed between the abundances of gliadin protein transcripts and the corresponding proteins.},

abstract = {Summary
The concentration of free sugars (glucose, fructose and sucrose) and inulin was measured in chicory roots (Cichorium intybus L. var. foliosum cv. Flash) during two growing seasons. Roots were harvested approximately every 2 weeks between June and October. They were either used immediately for sugar analysis or after a cold treatment. After the final harvest, samples were taken during the whole storage period of several months. The evolution pattern of free sugars and inulin during the growing season was very similar to previously reported data. When the long storage period after the vegetative growing year was considered, the changes in free sucrose (increase), and inulin bound glucose and fructose (decrease) mainly occurred at the first 60 days of storage. The apex was not necessary for perception of the cold signal. From the start of the growing season, cold treatment caused a strong decrease in free glucose and increases in free fructose and sucrose. Thus, still very young roots reacted to cold treatment by hydrolysis of inulin. Even at this young stage, the apex was not necessary for perception of the cold signal.},

A pseudo-likelihood estimation procedure is developed to fit this class of mixed models based on an approximate marginal model for the mean response. The procedure is implemented via iterated fitting of a weighted Gaussian linear mixed model to a modified dependent variable. The approach allows for flexible specification of covariance structures for both the random effects and the correlated errors. An estimate of an additional dispersion parameter for underlying exponential family distributions is optionally automatic. The method allows for subject-specific and population-averaged inference, and the Salamander data example from McCullagh and Nelder (1989) is used to illustrate both.},

@article{blackman_maturation_1991-1,
abstract = {A set of proteins that accumulates late in embryogenesis (Lea proteins) has been hypothesized to have a role in protecting the mature seed against desiccation damage. A possible correlation between their presence and the desiccation tolerant state in soybean seeds (Glycine max L. Chippewa) was tested. Proteins that showed the same temporal pattern of expression as that reported for Lea proteins were identified in the axes of soybean. They were distinct from the known storage proteins and were resistant to heat coagulation. The level of these “maturation” proteins was closely correlated with desiccation tolerance both in the naturally developing and in the germinating seed: increasing at 44 days after flowering, when desiccation tolerance was achieved, and decreasing after 18 hours of imbibition, when desiccation tolerance was lost. During imbibition, 100 micromolar abscisic acid or Polyethylene glycol-6000 (−0.6 megapascals) delayed disappearance of the maturation proteins, loss of desiccation tolerance, and germination. During maturation, desiccation tolerance was prematurely induced when excised seeds were dried slowly but not when seeds were held for an equivalent time at high relative humidity. In contrast, maturation proteins were induced under both conditions. We conclude that maturation proteins may contribute to desiccation tolerance of soybean seeds, though they may not be sufficient to induce tolerance by themselves.},

Grain yield data from trials of value for cultivation and use common bean were analyzed. Grain yield, ecovalence, regression coefficient, and coefficient of determination were estimated considering location and sowing season per year, within each biennium. Subsequently, a analysis of variance these estimates was carried out, and repeatability was estimated in the biennia. Repeatability estimate for grain yield in most of the biennia was relatively high, but for ecovalence and regression coefficient it was null or of small magnitude, which indicates that confidence on identification of common bean lines for recommendation is greater when using means of yield, instead of stability parameters.},

abstract = {Many reports have been published on bioprospecting of endophytic fungi capable of producing high value bioactive molecules like, paclitaxel, vincristine, vinblastine, camptothecin and podophyllotoxin. However, commercial exploitation of endophytes for high value-low volume plant secondary metabolites remains elusive due to widely reported genomic instability of endophytes in the axenic culture. While most of the endophyte research focuses on screening endophytes for novel or existing high value biomolecules, very few reports seek to explore the possible mechanisms of production of host–plant associated or novel secondary metabolites in these organisms. With an overview of host–endophyte relationship and its possible impact on the secondary metabolite production potential of endophytes, the review highlights the evidence reported for and against the presence of host-independent biosynthetic machinery in endophytes. The review aims to address the question, why should and how can endophytes be exploited for large scale in vitro production of high value phytochemicals? In this regard, various bioprocess optimization strategies that have been applied to sustain and enhance the product yield from the endophytes have also been described in detail. Further, techniques like mixed fermentation/co-cultivation and use of epigenetic modifiers have also been discussed as potential strategies to activate cryptic gene clusters in endophytes, thereby aiding in novel metabolite discovery and overcoming the limitations associated with axenic culture of endophytes.},

abstract = {The United States produces 41{\%} of the world's corn and 38{\%} of the world's soybeans. These crops comprise two of the four largest sources of caloric energy produced and are thus critical for world food supply. We pair a panel of county-level yields for these two crops, plus cotton (a warmer-weather crop), with a new fine-scale weather dataset that incorporates the whole distribution of temperatures within each day and across all days in the growing season. We find that yields increase with temperature up to 29° C for corn, 30° C for soybeans, and 32° C for cotton but that temperatures above these thresholds are very harmful. The slope of the decline above the optimum is significantly steeper than the incline below it. The same nonlinear and asymmetric relationship is found when we isolate either time-series or cross-sectional variations in temperatures and yields. This suggests limited historical adaptation of seed varieties or management practices to warmer temperatures because the cross-section includes farmers' adaptations to warmer climates and the time-series does not. Holding current growing regions fixed, area-weighted average yields are predicted to decrease by 30–46{\%} before the end of the century under the slowest (B1) warming scenario and decrease by 63–82{\%} under the most rapid warming scenario (A1FI) under the Hadley III model.},

In addition, the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazy (DPPH) radical-scavenging activity, total phenolic, ascorbic acid, total sugar content, as well as titratable acidity (TA) were increased by blue light exposure.

abstract = {This study's main contribution is to theoretically analyze the application of bootstrap methods to instrumental variable models when the available instruments may be weak and the number of instruments goes to infinity with the sample size. We demonstrate that a standard residual-based bootstrap procedure cannot consistently estimate the distribution of the limited information maximum likelihood estimator or Fuller (1977) estimator under many/many weak instrument sequence. The primary reason is that the standard procedure fails to capture the instrument strength in the sample adequately. In addition, we consider the restricted efficient (RE) bootstrap of Davidson and MacKinnon (2008, 2010, 2014) that generates bootstrap data under the null (restricted) and uses an efficient estimator of the coefficient of the reduced-form equation (efficient). We find that the RE bootstrap is also invalid; however, it effectively mimics more key features in the limiting distributions of interest, and thus, is less distorted in finite samples than the standard bootstrap procedure. Finally, we propose modified bootstrap procedures that provide a valid distributional approximation for the two estimators with many/many weak instruments. A Monte Carlo experiment shows that hypothesis testing based on the asymptotic normal approximation can have severe size distortions in finite samples. Instead, our modified bootstrap procedures greatly reduce these distortions.},

abstract = {A seeding rate for oat (Avena sativa L.) of 500 viable seeds m−2 is used in Finland for development of a uniculm stand, and to avoid post-anthesis tillering and subsequent uneven ripening of the crop. Plant breeding has, however, considerably altered plant height and plant stand structure, thereby possibly changing tillering capacity. The objective of this study was to assess the contribution of tillers to grain yield and morpho-physiological traits comparing an oat landrace cultivar (Jalostettu maatiainen), a modern cultivar (Puhti), and a semi-dwarf line (Hja 76416) when grown at 200 to 900 viable seeds m−2 at increments of 100 seeds m−2. The experiments were conducted at Viikki Experimental Farm, University of Helsinki, Finland (60°13′N), in 1991 and 1992. Increasing the seeding rate significantly increased the number of main culms m−2, but decreased straw length and several yield components on the main shoot. Tillers in the semi-dwarf line contributed 27{\%} to the grain yield at 200 seeds m−2. This line yielded highest at 600 seeds m−2 which favored a uniculm growth habit, and 98{\%} of grain yield was solely from main panicles. Due to the sensitivity of the landrace and modern cultivar to lodging, no significant effect of seeding rate on grain yield was recorded under favorable growing conditions (1991). The highest grain yield for them was recorded at 600 to 800 seeds m−2 with early summer drought (1992). No tiller contribution to grain yield was observed at ⩾ 500 seeds m−2. Following sensitivity to lodging the optimum seeding rate for the longer strawed lines is lower and more dependent on environmental factors than that for the semi-dwarf line.},

abstract = {Twelve white common bean genotypes were evaluated along two checks at three diverse locations in the mid-altitude of Bale zone, southeastern Ethiopia for two consecutive years 2014 and 2015 in order to determine their stability. The genotype by environment interaction (GEI) has an influence on the selection and recommendation of cultivars. The objective of this work was to see the effect of GEI and evaluate the adaptability and stability of productivity of twelve white common bean genotypes using additive main effect and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) model. The combined analysis of variance over locations revealed highly significant differences among the genotypes, locations and genotypes by location interaction. Among the 14 genotypes, the maximum grain yield over locations was obtained by genotype (G5) ICN Bunsi X S X B 405/5C-1C-1C-51 (2.05t/ha) followed by (G11) ICN Bunsi X S X B 405/7C-1C-1C-30 (1.96t/ha), and the site that gave the maximum grain yield was Ginir (2.16t/ha). The results of AMMI analysis indicated that the first four AMMI (AMMI-AMMI4) were highly significant (P{\textless}0.01). The GEI - was two times higher than that of the genotype effect, suggesting the possible existence of different environment groups. Based on the stability parameters like AMMI stability value (ASV), G12, G5, G7, G11, G3 and G13 were found to be as stable cultivars, respectively. As stability per se is not a desirable selection criterion and the most stable genotypes would not necessarily give the best yield performance, simultaneous consideration of grain yield and ASV in a single non-parametric index were also considered in identification of best varieties.

abstract = {Linear and non-linear rheological properties of wheat gliadin and glutenin suspensions were investigated at various concentrations. Linear dynamic viscoelastic properties for both gliadin and glutenin were strongly dependent on concentration. For gliadins, the storage moduli (G′), loss moduli (G″), and phase shifts dramatically changed within a narrow concentration range, indicating that gliadin suspension properties changed from viscous to viscoelastic. Glutenins exhibited viscoelastic solid behaviour at all measured concentrations. The non-linear shear viscoelastic properties of gliadin and glutenin also depended on concentration. Viscosities of gliadins displayed shear-thinning behaviour; viscosities for glutenins showed shear-thickening behaviour at low shear rates, and shear-thinning behaviour at higher shear rates. Our results indicate that gliadin's structure in suspension changes over a small concentration range, and suggest that gliadin is important in adjusting and controlling gluten's viscoelastic behaviour, and not only as a diluent of gluten's functional properties.},

abstract = {White mold, caused by Sclerotinea sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary is one of the most important diseases of the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) worldwide. Physiological resistance and traits related to disease avoidance such as architecture contribute to field resistance. The aim of this study was to verify the efficiency of recurrent selection in physiological resistance to white mold, “Carioca” grain type and upright habit in common bean. Thirteen common bean lines with partial resistance to white mold were intercrossed by means of a circulant diallel table, and seven recurrent selection cycles were obtained. Of these cycles, progenies of the S0:1, S0:2 and S0:3 generations of cycles III, IV, V and VI were evaluated. The best (8 to 10) progenies of the seven cycles were also evaluated, in two experiments, one in the greenhouse and one in the field. Lattice and/or randomized block experimental designs were used. The traits evaluated were: resistance to white mold by the straw test method, growth habit and grain type. The most resistant progenies were selected based on the average score of resistance to white mold. Subsequently, they were evaluated with regard to grain type and growth habit. Recurrent selection allowed for genetic progress of about 11 {\%} per year for white mold resistance and about 15 {\%} per year for the plant architecture. There was no gain among cycles for grain type. Progeny selection and recurrent selection were efficient for obtaining progenies with a high level of resistance to white mold with “Carioca” grain type and upright habit.Key words: Sclerotinia sclerotiorum; Phaseolus vulgaris; genetic resistance; genetic progress},

This article analyzes these releases for maize ethanol produced in the United States. Factoring market-mediated responses and by-product use into our analysis reduces cropland conversion by 72{\%} from the land used for the ethanol feedstock. Consequently, the associated GHG release estimated in our framework is 800 grams of carbon dioxide per megajoule (MJ); 27 grams per MJ per year, over 30 years of ethanol production, or roughly a quarter of the only other published estimate of releases attributable to changes in indirect land use. Nonetheless, 800 grams are enough to cancel out the benefits that corn ethanol has on global warming, thereby limiting its potential contribution in the context of California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard.},

We studied the impact of nitrogen (N) nutrition (nitrate/ NO 3 - or ammonium/ NH 4 + nitrogen) and subsequent nitrogen deficit on phenolic metabolites and physiology in Matricaria chamomilla plants. NH 4 + -fed plants revealed a strong induction of selected phenolic metabolites but, at the same time, growth, Fv/Fm, tissue water content and soluble protein depletion occurred in comparison with NO 3 - -fed ones. On the other hand, NO 3 - -deficient plants also revealed an increase in phenolic metabolites but growth depression was not observed after the given exposure period. Free amino acids were more accumulated in NH 4 + -fed shoots (strong increase in arginine and proline mainly), while the pattern of roots' accumulation was independent of N form. Among phenolic acids, NH 4 + strongly elevated mainly the accumulation of chlorogenic acid. Within flavonoids, flavonols decreased while flavones strongly increased in response to N deficiency. Coumarin-related metabolites revealed a similar increase in herniarin glucosidic precursor in response to N deficiency, while herniarin was more accumulated in NO 3 - - and umbelliferone in NH 4 + -cultured plants. These data indicate a negative impact of NH 4 + as the only source of N on physiology, but also a higher stimulation of some valuable phenols. Nitrogen-induced changes in comparison with other food/crop plants are discussed.},

abstract = {Crop simulation models are used at the field scale to estimate crop yield potential, optimize current management, and benchmark input-use efficiency. At issue is the ability of crop models to predict local and regional actual yield and total production without need of site-year specific calibration of internal parameters associated with fundamental physiological processes. In this study, a well-validated maize simulation model was used to estimate yield potential for 45 locations across the U.S. Corn Belt, including both irrigated and rainfed environments, during four years (2011–2014) that encompassed diverse weather conditions. Simulations were based on measured weather data, dominant soil properties, and key management practices at each location (including sowing date, hybrid maturity, and plant density). The same set of internal model parameters were used across all site-years. Simulated yields were upscaled from locations to larger spatial domains (county, agricultural district, state, and region), following a bottom-up approach based on a climate zone scheme and distribution of maize harvested area. Simulated yields were compared against actual yields reported at each spatial level, both in absolute terms as well as deviations from long-term averages. Similar comparisons were performed for total maize production, estimated as the product of simulated yields and official statistics on maize harvested area in each year. At county-level, the relationship between simulated and actual yield was better described by a curvilinear model, with decreasing agreement at higher yields ({\textgreater}12 Mg ha−1). Comparison of actual and simulated yield anomalies, as estimated from the yearly yield deviations from the long-term actual and simulated average yield, indicated a linear relationship at county-level. In both cases (absolute yields and yield anomalies comparisons), the agreement increased with increasing spatial aggregation (from county to region). An approach based on long-term actual and simulated yields and year-specific simulated yield allowed estimation of actual yield with a high degree of accuracy at county level (RMSE ≤ 18{\%}), even in years with highly favorable weather or severe drought. Estimates of total production, which are of greatest interest to buyers and sellers in the market, were also in close agreement with actual production (RMSE ≤ 22{\%}). The approach proposed here to estimate yield and production can complement other approaches that rely on surveys, field crop cuttings, and empirical statistical methods and serve as basis for in-season yield and production forecasts.},

Furthermore, the proposed bootstrap is robust to model misspecification, i.e., it achieves asymptotic refinements regardless of whether the assumed moment condition model is correctly specified or not. This result is new, because asymptotic refinements of the bootstrap based on these estimators have not been established in the literature even under correct model specification. Monte Carlo experiments are conducted in dynamic panel data setting to support the theoretical finding. As an application, bootstrap confidence intervals for the returns to schooling of Hellerstein and Imbens (1999) are calculated. The result suggests that the returns to schooling may be higher.},

The total biomass was unaffected by the spectrum in campanulas, while the leaf area was smallest in the 40{\%} Blue/60{\%} Red treatment. In 100{\%} Red curled leaves and other morphological abnormalities were observed. Increasing the blue to red ratio increased the stomatal conductance though net photosynthesis was unaffected, indicating excess stomatal conductance in some treatments. With higher blue light ratio all phenolic acids and flavonoids increased. In view of the roles of these secondary metabolites as antioxidants, anti-pathogens, and light protectants, we hypothesize that blue light may predispose plants to better cope with stress.},

abstract = {In intensive rice–wheat systems of north-west (NW) India, surface retention of rice residues in wheat has been recommended instead of burning. Optimum nitrogen (N) management for zero till (ZT) wheat sown into rice residues may to differ from that of conventional practice (in-situ burning of residues followed by intensive tillage prior to sowing). Therefore, we conducted several on-farm and on-station field experiments in 2007–2008 to 2012–2013 to evaluate N management practices for ZT wheat sown into rice residues using the Happy Seeder. The optimum N rate for wheat planted into rice residues in fields with no or only a short history of rice residue retention was 120 kg N ha−1, the current recommendation for conventional practice. Short-term (up to 20 d) soil N mineralization was lower in undisturbed soil than disturbed soil, while the total amount of N mineralization was similar after 40 d, suggesting that over the crop season, total soil N mineralization may be similar in tilled and non-tilled soil. Ammonia volatilization loss from urea broadcast over the residue covered surface, followed by irrigation, was low ({\textless}2 kg ha−1) regardless of time of urea application. Band placement of 20{\%} of the fertilizer N as diammonium phosphate at seeding, and topdressing of the remaining 80{\%} as urea in two equal doses before first and second irrigations produced higher grain yield and N use efficiency than other treatments. However, surface residue retention reduces the rate of soil drying and in some situations this delays the time of the second irrigation and thus N fertilizer application beyond the optimum time. Therefore, the effect of banding various proportions of the urea N between the rows at sowing was investigated. The results showed that, on a loam soil, up to 75{\%} of the recommended N fertilizer can be applied at sowing, 24 kg N ha−1 as DAP with the seed and 66 kg N ha−1 as urea drilled between every second wheat row, without loss of yield. In conclusion, a better applied N management strategy for ZT wheat than currently practiced is drilling of 24 kg N ha−1 as diammonimum phosphate into the soil at seeding followed by two top-dressings of 48 kg N ha−1 each just prior to first and second irrigations.},

Results revealed that relatively high (35 °C) or low (15 °C) temperatures reduced the photosynthetic efficiency of the leaves of St. John's wort plants and resulted in low CO2 assimilation. Net photosynthetic rates and the maximal quantum efficiency of PSII photochemistry of the dark adopted leaves (ϕpmax) decreased significantly in the leaves of plants grown under 35 or 15 °C temperature treatments. High temperature (35 °C) treatment increased the leaf total peroxidase activity and also increased the hypericin, pseudohypericin and hyperforin concentrations in the shoot tissues. These results provide the first indication that temperature is an important environmental factor to optimize the secondary metabolite production in St. John's wort and controlled environment technology can allow the precise application of such specific stresses.},

abstract = {The goal of the present work was to analyze the Brody, Von Bertalanffy, Richards, Log{\'{i}}stic and Gompertz functions in order to describe the growth in crossbred sheep Dorper × Morada Nova (DMN), Dorper × Rabo Largo (DRL) and Dorper × Santa In{\^{e}}s (DSI). After defining the best adjusted model, the absolute growth rate was calculated and the influence of both environmental and genetic features on curve parameters was evaluated. The data were based on 156 F1 animals (36 DMN, 61 DRL and 59 DSI), weighed quarterly from birth up to 210 days of age. Both Gompertz and Logistic functions presented the best adjustment, being the latter slightly superior. The mature weight was statistically similar among the three genetic groups. However, the DSI group presented a faster growth during the pre-weaning period, with a remarkable fall from the inflection point on. The weight gain within such group was lower to those from DRL and DMN groups from 150 days of age on. Only the birth month has significantly influenced the asymptotic weight (A). The growth rate (k) was affected by birth month, type of parturition, sex, genetic group and parturition type vs. genetic group interaction. The estimated correlation between the parameters A and k were negative (−0.58 for DMN, −0.39 for DSI and −0.38 for DRL), indicating that more precocious animals are less likely to reach higher weights when adults.},

abstract = {The stay-green trait is responsible for the preservation of green coloration in the stem and leaf, during physiological maturity. It has also been shown to play an important role in the increase of grain size. The knowledge of the inheritance of this trait can constitute valuable information to plant breeders in the developing new wheat (Triti-cum aestivum L.) varieties. This study was conducted in two environments, during the years of 1997 and 1998, to verify the genetic basis of the stay-green trait among crosses of four different genotypes in the field and three in the greenhouse. The analysis was based on three fixed (P1, P2 and F1) and three segregating (F2, BC1F1 and BC2F1) generations. Means and variances were computed for every generation for each cross and the nature of the gene and its effects were estimated. Change in stem color was used as the criterion for the stay-green trait in three phases of development in wheat, based on scores obtained from visual analysis, on a scale of 1 to 10. The results presented in the 2nd observation phase, suggest that the stay-green trait is controlled by only one gene with two alleles and gene activity with high predominance of additive effects and to a lesser degree, a partial dominance for stay green.},

@article{hopke_herbivore-induced_1994-1,
abstract = {The treatment of healthy, undamaged plants of the Lima bean Phaseolus lunatus with solutions of a $\beta$-glucosidase from bitter almonds (at 5 U{\textperiodcentered}ml−1) through the petiole results in an enhanced emission of volatiles to the environment. The compounds are identical with those emitted in response to infestation with the red spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae. Dominant products are the two acyclic homoterpenes 4,8-dimethyl-1,3E,7-dimethylnonatriene (homoterpene I) and 4,8,12-trimethyl-1,3E,7E,11-tridecatetraene (homoterpene II) which are of sesquiterpenoid and diterpenoid origin. Therefore, a $\beta$-glucosidase of the herbivore may be considered as the true elicitor for the odor induction. Homoterpene I and most other of the herbivore-induced volatiles can also be triggered by treatment of the plant with solutions of jasmonic acid (JA) at 100 nmol{\textperiodcentered}ml−1 to 10 $\mu$mol{\textperiodcentered}ml−1. The C16 homoterpene II is not significantly induced by JA. The time—course of the enzymatic- and the JA-triggered induction of the volatiles is identical. The dose—response to JA parallels previous reports on alkaloid induction in cell cultures. In corn plants (Zea mays) JA triggers the emission of all volatiles which are known to be emitted in response to the damage by the beet army worm Spodoptora exigua. In summary, the emission of volatiles after damage by a herbivore resembles the production of phytoalexins in response to an attacking microorganism and uses similar elicitors and internal transduction pathways.},

When for example, it can be assumed that there is no interaction between the repeated measure factor and the treatment, it would be of interest to know how much of a difference exists in the effect of the treatments. Such differences in the absence of interaction are referred to as level differences. In this paper, we consider methods for constructing confidence regions for level differences in the multi-dimensional cases. We derive asymptotic expansions for some intuitively appealing pivotal quantities to construct the confidence regions corrected up to the second order. Such corrections are shown in the multivariate literature to improve the accuracy of asymptotic approximations. We evaluate the finite sample performance of the confidence regions via a simulation study. Real-data example from forestry is used to provide an empirical illustration of the features of the various confidence regions proposed in the paper.},

Sphagnum peat moss is a primary constituent of these substrates and its harvest from endangered ecosystems has become a worldwide concern. Ethanol-extracted, coarse-ground corn (Zea mays L. ‘Silver Queen') tassels were used as a peat replacement for potting substrates. Replacing peat moss with increasing levels of ground tassel (up to 50{\%}, v/v) elevated pH and electrical conductance, while having variable effects on substrate physical properties (bulk density, percent solids, air porosity, container capacity, and total porosity). Two identical greenhouse experiments separated by time were conducted using tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L. ‘Red Robin') plants grown in 6.0-L pots. In the first experiment, all substrates were similar for total tomato yield per plant and number of fruit per plant, with only the 50{\%} tassel substrate having significantly lower values. There were no differences for plant height or average fruit weight among substrates. No differences were found for any of these variables in the second experiment. This research indicates that extracted ground tassels may be utilized as a suitable replacement for peat in greenhouse substrates for tomatoes.},

abstract = {Kernels of 28 different maize (Zea mays L.) genotypes consisting of several inbreds isogenic for the starch-deficient endosperm mutations sugary 1 (su1), sugary1 sugary enhancer 1 (su1se1), and shrunken2 (sh2) were used to study the effect of these mutations on carbohydrate composition and $\alpha$-amylase expression during germination and seedling growth in comparison to normal starchy kernels (Su). Sugar (fructose, glucose, sucrose, and maltose), WSP (water-soluble polysaccharide), and insoluble starch contents were determined for endosperm and scutellar tissues for each of the genotypes at four stages of seedling development. While initial levels of endosperm sucrose were higher in the endosperm mutants, they rapidly declined by radicle emergence and remained low thereafter. Mobilization of carbohydrate reserves was most reduced in the sh2 genotypes. Collectively, these factors represent a limited carbon supply for the developing sh2 seedling which may impact seedling vigor. A more significant negative correlation was observed between percentage germination and endosperm sugar content than between percentage germination and scutellar sugar content. High initial levels of endosperm sucrose in the mutants correlate with a severe reduction of $\alpha$-amylase (EC 3.2.1.1) transcript abundance. The same correlation does not hold for glucose and maltose, as at later stages of germination, levels were significantly higher in the Su genotype while the $\alpha$-amylase mRNA levels remained high. Furthermore, the ratio of $\alpha$-amylase enzyme activity to transcript abundance was considerably lower in the sh2 aleurone compared to the Su aleurone at radicle emergence. Genotype specific differences in $\alpha$-amylase gene expression strongly correlate with endosperm sugar content and composition during germination.},

The aim of this study was to investigate post-anthesis N translocation in the spike and into different spikelets of two cultivars of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grown to maturity in solution culture. Sport (short grain filling time, low yield and high grain protein concentration) and WL (normal grain filling time, high yield and low protein concentration) were the cultivars used. Plants received stepwise declining rates of N on a daily basis, until 109 days after planting (DAP). Anthesis for cv. Sport was 92 DAP and for cv. WL 78 DAP. On seven occasions (from anthesis in cv. WL until maturity), 15N was given to selected groups of plants for 4 days. Then these plants were sampled and separated into plant parts. Spikelets and grains were separated according to spikelet position. Plant parts were weighed and analysed for N and 15N.The N concentration in the grains was uniform for the spikelets in cv. WL but differed in cv. Sport. Final N concentration in a spikelet position was obtained at 126 DAP in cv. Sport and 112 DAP in cv. WL and was constant to the end of experiment at 154 DAP in cv. Sport and 147 DAP in cv. WL. A positive correlation between {\%} atom excess 15N to spikelet position numbered from the base of the spike was exhibited in the lowermost part of the spike just after anthesis. Later, during grain filling, a negative correlation between {\%} atom excess 15N to spikelet position was exhibited (−0{\textperiodcentered}991 P=0{\textperiodcentered}000). A positive correlation between {\%} atom excess 15N to grain weight in the top of the spike was exhibited. Accumulation of 15N proceeded 14 days longer in the lowermost fertile spikelets than in the uppermost spikelets. It was concluded that the duration of N accumulation in the spikelets was dependent on spikelet position and uppermost spikelets had a shorter N accumulation period and contained lighter grains than lowermost spikelets.},

Elevated CO2 significantly stimulated total biomass of the plant grown in moderate and high N condition. Further, change in pattern of biomass partitioning was also observed under different CO2 and N treatments and plant allocated its maximum biomass toward stem under elevated CO2 at all N treatments. Leaf biomass showed its highest proportion with high N, under elevated CO2. Elevated CO2 rather significantly increased starch, organic carbon, while it decreased soluble sugar in higher N supply. Plants grown with low level of N showed significant reduction in total foliar nitrogen due to CO2 enrichment. Under elevated CO2, total alkaloids, vinblastine and vincristine were highest at moderate N; however, catharanthine content was increased linearly with increasing supply of N. On the other hand, vindoline content was reduced under elevated CO2 with high N. Principal component analysis and factor rotation were conducted to understand the cumulative response of all the variables to elevated CO2 and N availability. The differential response of the test plant under varying CO2 and N levels concluded that C-allocation toward biomass and metabolites synthesis under future projected level of CO2 will be greatly modified by soil nitrogen availability. Furthermore, moderate N supply would be more beneficial for medicinal value of the test plant.},

@article{facchini_plant_2000-1,
abstract = {A comprehensive survey of the extensive literature relevant to the evolution, physiology, biochemistry, regulation, and genetic engineering applications of plant aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylases (AADCs) is presented. AADCs catalyze the pyridoxal–5′–phosphate (PLP)-dependent decarboxylation of select aromatic L-amino acids in plants, mammals, and insects. Two plant AADCs, L-tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC) and L-tyrosine decarboxylase (TYDC), have attracted considerable attention because of their role in the biosynthesis of pharmaceutically important monoterpenoid indole alkaloids and benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, respectively. Although plant and animal AADCs share extensive amino acid homology, the enzymes display striking differences in their substrate specificities. AADCs from mammals and insects accept a broad range of aromatic L-amino acids, whereas TDC and TYDC from plants exhibit exclusive substrate specificity for L-amino acids with either indole or phenol side chains, but not both. Recent biochemical and kinetic studies on animal AADCs support basic features of the classic AADC reaction mechanism. The catalytic mechanism involves the formation of a Schiff base between PLP and an invariable lysine residue, followed by a transaldimination reaction with an aromatic L-amino acid substrate. Both TDC and TYDC are primarily regulated at the transcriptional level by developmental and environmental factors. However, the putative post-translational regulation of TDC via the ubiquitin pathway, by an ATP-dependent proteolytic process, has also been suggested. Isolated TDC and TYDC genes have been used to genetically alter the regulation of secondary metabolic pathways derived from aromatic amino acids in several plant species. The metabolic modifications include increased serotonin levels, reduced indole glucosinolate levels, redirected shikimate metabolism, increased indole alkaloid levels, and increased cell wall-bound tyramine levels.},

abstract = {Nitrogen (N) nutrition, post‐anthesis temperature and drought‐induced changes in the kinetics of accumulation of dry mass, total grain N and protein fractions (albumins‐globulins, amphiphils, gliadins, and glutenins) contents were examined for winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Crops were grown in controlled environment tunnels in 1994 and 1998. In 1994, five post‐anthesis temperatures averaging from 15–25 °C were applied during grain‐filling. In 1998 two post‐anthesis temperatures averaging 13 °C and 20 °C were applied and factorized with two post‐anthesis water regimes. In 1994 crops also were grown in the field, where different application rates and timing of N nutrition were tested. When expressed in thermal time, the kinetics of accumulation of the protein fractions were not significantly affected by post‐anthesis temperature or drought; whereas N nutrition significantly increased the rate and duration of accumulation of storage proteins. Albumin‐globulin proteins accumulated during the early stage of grain development. The rate of accumulation of that fraction decreased significantly at c. 250 °Cd after anthesis, when the storage proteins (gliadins and glutenins) started to accumulate significantly. Single allometric relationships for the different environmental conditions exist between the quantity of each protein fraction and the total quantity of N per grain. From these results it was concluded that (1) the process of N partitioning is neither significantly affected by post‐anthesis temperature or drought nor by the rate and timing of N nutrition and (2) at maturity, variations in protein fraction composition are mainly because of differences in the total quantity of N accumulated during grain‐filling.},

abstract = {The expression of desacetoxyvindoline 4-hydroxylase (D4H), which catalyzes the second to the last reaction in vindoline biosynthesis inCatharanthus roseus, appears to be under complex, multilevel developmental and light regulation. Developmental studies with etiolated and light-treated seedlings suggested that although light had variable effects on the levels of d4htranscripts, those of D4H protein and enzyme activity could be increased, depending on seedling development, up to 9- and 8-fold, respectively, compared with etiolated seedlings. However, light treatment of etiolated seedlings could stop and reverse the decline ofd4h transcripts at later stages of seedling development. Repeated exposure of seedlings to light was also required to maintain the full spectrum of enzyme activity observed during seedling development. Further studies showed that a photoreversible phytochrome appeared to be involved in the activation of D4H, since red-light treatment of etiolated seedlings increased the detectable levels ofd4h transcripts, D4H protein, and D4H enzyme activity, whereas far-red-light treatment completely reversed this process. Additional studies also confirmed that different major isoforms of D4H protein exist in etiolated (isoelectric point, 4.7) and light-grown (isoelectric point, 4.6) seedlings, suggesting that a component of the light-mediated activation of D4H may involve an undetermined posttranslational modification. The biological reasons for this complex control of vindoline biosynthesis may be related to the need to produce structures that could sequester away from cellular activities the cytotoxic vinblastine and vincristine dimers that are derived partially from vindoline.},

abstract = {Plant growth and secondary metabolism are commonly regulated by external cues such as light, temperature and water availability. In this study, the influences of low and high temperatures, dehydration, photoperiods, and different growing stages on the changes of steviol glycosides (SGs) contents and transcription levels of fifteen genes involved in SGs biosynthesis of Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni were examined using HPLC and RT-PCR. The observations showed that the transcript levels of all the fifteen genes were maximum under 25 °C treatment, and the transcription of SrDXS, SrDXR, SrMCT, SrCMK, SrMDS, SrHDS, SrHDR, SrIDI, SrGGDPS, SrCPPS1, SrUGT85C2 and SrUGT76G1 were restrained both in low temperature (15 °C) and high temperature (35 °C). Most genes in SGs biosynthesis pathway exhibited down-regulation in dehydration. To elucidate the effect of photoperiods, the plants were treated by different simulated photoperiods (8L/16D, 10L/14D, 14L/10D and 16L/8D), but no significant transcription changes were observed. In the study of growing stages, there were evident changes of SGs contents, and the transcript levels of all the fifteen genes were minimal in fast growing period, and exhibited evident increase both in flower-bud appearing stage and flowering stage. The obtained results strongly suggest that the effect of environmental cues on steviol glycosides contents and transcription of corresponding biosynthetic genes in S. rebaudiana is significant. It is worth to study deeply.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to characterize the genetic (crossbreeding and additive genetic) and environmental factors affecting reproduction of sows on an outdoor production system. Data from the Experimental Swine Unit of Facultad de Agronom{\'{i}}a, Progreso, Uruguay, were used. The breeding herd included purebred Pampa Rocha (P) and Duroc (D), as well as hybrid (H: P×D and D×P) sows. Pampa Rocha is considered the only local swine breed of Uruguay. The dataset contained 1309 litter records from 197 sows (136 P, 22 D and 39 H) collected from 1997 to 2011. Feeding was based on grazing, restricting the use of concentrate to the breeding herd. The variables analysed were: number of piglets born alive (PBA), average piglet weight of the litter at birth (ABW), number of piglets weaned (PW), average piglet weight of the litter at weaning (AWW), survival from birth to weaning (S) and weaning-to-conception interval (WCI). The following fixed factors were included in the final model: year of farrowing, time of the year (month or season, depending on the variable analysed), inbreeding of the sow, parity number, weaning age, direct breed effects, individual heterosis, repeated measures on the sow (used to estimate the permanent environment effect), and the animal random effect. Duroc sows produced 1.1 more PBA (p=0.03) than P sows. Significant heterosis effects were found for PBA (0.88 piglets, p=0.009) and for PW (0.72 piglets, p=0.03). Hybrid sows produced 1.43 and 1.15 piglets more than P sows, and 0.33 and 0.29 piglets more than D sows, born alive and weaned, respectively. No differences in other variables between genotypes were found. Heritability values (SE) were 0.13 (0.06) for PBA, 0.31 (0.08) for ABW, 0.14 (0.06) for PW, 0.17 (0.02) for AWW, 0.10 (0.01) for S and 0.08 (0.03) for WCI. Winter and spring farrowings resulted in heavier piglets at birth (p{\textless}0.001) and at weaning (p{\textless}0.01), but no effect on PBA, P and S was observed. Weaning-to-conception interval was greater in summer months (p{\textless}0.001). The results suggest seasonal reproductive behaviour. The local breed (P) compared well with a conventional one (D). Furthermore, the crossbred dam appeared attractive due to heterosis in litter traits.},

abstract = {Evaluation of the association of haplotypes with either quantitative traits or disease status is common practice, and under some situations provides greater power than the evaluation of individual marker loci. The focus on haplotype analyses will increase as more single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are discovered, either because of interest in candidate gene regions, or because of interest in genome-wide association studies. However, there is little guidance on the determination of the sample size needed to achieve the desired power for a study, particularly when linkage phase of the haplotypes is unknown, and when a subset of tag-SNP markers is measured. There is a growing wealth of information on the distribution of haplotypes in different populations, and it is not unusual for investigators to measure genetic markers in pilot studies in order to gain knowledge of the distribution of haplotypes in the target population. Starting with this basic information on the distribution of haplotypes, we derive analytic methods to determine sample size or power to test the association of haplotypes with either a quantitative trait or disease status (e.g., a case-control study design), assuming that all subjects are unrelated. Our derivations cover both phase-known and phase-unknown haplotypes, allowing evaluation of the loss of efficiency due to unknown phase. We also extend our methods to when a subset of tag-SNPs is chosen, allowing investigators to explore the impact of tag-SNPs on power. Simulations illustrate that the theoretical power predictions are quite accurate over a broad range of conditions. Our theoretical formulae should provide useful guidance when planning haplotype association studies.},

abstract = {Ammonia (NH3) volatilization was measured with the continuous airflow enclosure chamber method under different urea application amounts using pots in paddy fields in Erhai Lake Watershed, China. Several factors, such as the urea nitrogen application amount, days after fertilization, NH4 +-N concentration and pH of surface water, and climate, that could affect ammonia volatilization were also studied. The results indicated that ammonia volatilization loss increased linearly with increasing amounts of applied urea. The ratios of the ammonia volatilization loss to the applied nitrogen ranged from 16.59 to 18.43 {\%} with different nitrogen application amounts. The ammonia volatilization loss peaked within the first 3 days after fertilization, which accounted for 65–82 {\%} of the total ammonia loss in each period. We observed the following degree of the effects of various factors on ammonia volatilization: NH4 +-N concentration of surface water {\{}{\textgreater}{\}} urea application amount {\{}{\textgreater}{\}} pH of surface water {\{}{\textgreater}{\}} days after fertilization {\{}{\textgreater}{\}} water temperature of surface water. The wind velocity and rainfall were the key factors affecting ammonia volatilization. The model of ammonia volatilization flux was established by using the measured dates from 2013 and was represented as Y = 0.008(x1 + x2 + x3) + e0.056x4−0.068x5−0.623 (R 2 = 0.81, P {\{}{\textless}{\}} 0.0001). The model was verified by using the measured dates from 2012. The calculated values fitted well with the field observations. However, the model parameters need to be amended using the model to predict the ammonia volatilization flux in the rice season from other regions.},

The experiment was conducted in Ira{\'{i}} de Minas, Brazil using a randomized block design with three replications under a 5 x 3 x 3 factorial arrangement, with five soybean cultivars (NK 7059 RR, SYN 1163 RR, SYN 9070 RR, AS 7307 RR and SYN 1283 RR), three harvesting periods (R8, R8 + one rain simulation in the pre-harvesting period and R8 + two simulations in the pre-harvesting period) under three storage times (0, 90 and 180 days). Seeds were evaluated for their chemical composition (lignin contents), the percentage of moisture damage using the tetrazolium test and physiological quality (germination, accelerated aging, conductivity test, seedling emergence and emergence index). Cultivar AS 7307 RR had the highest lignin content in the integument, the lowest percentage of damage by moisture and the highest physiological quality. Cultivars NK 7059 RR and SYN 1163 RR had the lowest lignin contents in the integument and the highest moisture damage. Electrical conductivity increased after storing all cultivars.Key words: Glycine max; lignin; storage},

abstract = {This chapter discusses the secondary metabolites in plant-insect interactions. It has long been accepted that plant-insect interactions involve the evolution of defensive secondary metabolic pathways in plants to which insects can adapt. New theories are being proposed to account for the wide diversity of such interactions, particularly where production of plant secondary metabolites is inducible. This chapter briefly describes the more widely known mechanisms by which secondary metabolites act, such as direct toxicity, antifeedancy and sequestration. Key areas covered in greater depth involve the volatile secondary metabolites produced by plants, both inherently and in response to the stress of insect feeding and colonization. Interactions described include the location of host plants by insects and the corresponding avoidance of unsuitable host plants. The roles of volatile plant compounds in the attraction of predators and parasitoids to plants already hosting insect populations, and in the synergism of insect pheromone activity, are discussed.},

abstract = {To deter pathogenic microorganisms and herbivores, plants have developed an inducible chemical defense system. It is known that the induced synthesis of low molecular weight compounds can be provoked by exposing cultured cells to fungal cell wall fragments. In this study we show that endogenous jasmonic acid and its methyl ester accumulate rapidly and transiently after treatment of plant cell suspension cultures of Rauvolfia canescens and Eschscholtzia californica with a yeast elicitor. Thirty-six plant species tested in cell suspension culture could be elicited with respect to the accumulation of secondary metabolites by exogenously supplied methyl jasmonate. Addition of methyl jasmonate initiates de novo transcription of genes, such as phenylalanine ammonia lyase, that are known to be involved in the chemical defense mechanisms of plants. These data demonstrate the integral role of jasmonic acid and its derivatives in the intracellular signal cascade that begins with interaction of an elicitor molecule with the plant cell surface and results, ultimately, in the accumulation of secondary compounds.},

abstract = {One of the factors that may influence N cycling in boreal forest soils is the ability of tannins to precipitate proteins and certain other organic N compounds, which may lead to creation of recalcitrant complexes. The objective of this study was to determine how additions of condensed tannins (CT) and CT–organic N compounds (OrgN; bovine serum albumin–BSA, chitin, d-ribulose 1,5-diphosphate carboxylase–Rubisco) affect carbon and nitrogen transformations in birch soil. Condensed tannins were extracted from Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) needles. Soil samples were taken from the organic layer at two study sites, Kivalo (N-poor soil) and Kerim{\"{a}}ki (N-rich soil), and incubated with the above-mentioned compounds in laboratory conditions for one month. For purposes of comparison, uncomplexed OrgN was added to soil samples. Carbon dioxide evolution (C mineralization), net N mineralization and N and C in the microbial biomass were then measured. Addition of CT decreased the amount of C in the microbial biomass, and rates of C mineralization (only in N-poor soil) and net nitrification, suggesting a toxic and/or protein-precipitating effect. Additions of uncomplexed OrgN increased both CO2 production and net mineralization of N. In the N-poor Kivalo soil, additions of uncomplexed OrgN caused a greater increase than did addition of OrgN–CT complexes; in N-rich Kerim{\"{a}}ki soil, such pattern was clear only for Rubisco. In N-poor Kivalo soil, additions of chitin and BSA increased the amount of N in microbial biomass, but again the increase was greater for uncomplexed OrgN than for the complex. Changes in amount of C in the microbial biomass (both soils) and in N in the microbial biomass in N-rich Kerim{\"{a}}ki soil were less clear. Our study indicates that OrgN–CT complexes undergo some digestion in soil. Depending on the soil, complexes with chitin may act similarly to protein–tannin complexes.},

Results showed that genomic selection modified the growth curve. Responses to all selection criteria were accompanied with a correlated response in mature weight due to the high genetic correlations between mature weight and the 2 rate parameters. Responses to selection were affected by the loss of accuracy over generations of genomic selection due to the loss of gametic disequilibrium between SNP and genes determining the parameters. In conclusion, genomic selection can be used for changing growth curve parameters. However, changing the whole curve (birth weight, adult BW, and curve shape) is not easy due to the correlation between all BW along the growth of the animal. Applying genomic selection will require a constant reevaluation of the associations between SNP and genes determining the curve parameters.},

The method is a modification of that proposed by Lin (1982), who used the equivalent of the genotype x environment interaction mean squares for clustering. Lin fused on the minimum genotype x environment interaction mean square within potential new clusters at each fusion cycle. HASS clustering, however, uses the pooled genotype x environment interaction sums of squares within all clusters (new and old) at each fusion cycle. HASS clustering is shown to more nearly achieve the objective of minimizing the pooled interaction mean square within clusters and maximizing the interaction mean square among clusters when compared with Lin's (1982) method and the widely used average linkage method.},

Sclerotia naturally formed in soybean plants in an infested commercial field were collected in a grain-cleaning machine and those present in the stem pith, with c.a. 8 mm in length and 1.9 mm in diameter were selected. Fifty sclerotia were kept inside a white nylon mesh (0.25mm) screen bag (25 x 25cm). Eighty bags were laid on the soil surface-simulating no till farming. At monthly intervals, four bags were taken and brought to the laboratory. Sclerotia were washed with tap water and surface desinfested with sodium hypochlorite and exposed to germinate on sterilized moist river sand in a growth chamber at 15oC and 12h photoperiod. After 12 months, sclerotia kept on the soil surface, lost their viability. It may be concluded that under no till, crop rotation with nonsusceptible crops, can reduce the sclerotia bank in the soil.},

@article{miransari_plant_2014,
abstract = {Seed germination is controlled by a number of mechanisms and is necessary for the growth and development of the embryo, resulting in the eventual production of a new plant. Under unfavorable conditions seeds may become dormant (secondary dormancy) to maintain their germination ability. However, when the conditions are favorable seeds can germinate. There are a number of factors controlling seed germination and dormancy, including plant hormones, which are produced by both plant and soil bacteria. Interactions between plant hormones and plant genes affect seed germination. While the activity of plant hormones is controlled by the expression of genes at different levels, there are plant genes that are activated in the presence of specific plant hormones. Hence, adjusting gene expression may be an effective way to enhance seed germination. The hormonal signaling of IAA and gibberellins has been presented as examples during plant growth and development including seed germination. Some interesting results related to the effects of seed gene distribution on regulating seed activities have also been presented. The role of soil bacteria is also of significance in the production of plant hormones during seed germination, as well as during the establishment of the seedling, by affecting the plant rhizosphere. Most recent findings regarding seed germination and dormancy are reviewed. The significance of plant hormones including abscisic acid, ethylene, gibberellins, auxin, cytokinins and brassinosteroids, with reference to proteomic and molecular biology studies on germination, is also discussed. This review article contains almost a complete set of details, which may affect seed biology during dormancy and growth.},

abstract = {Europe's managed forests contribute to warming
For most of the past 250 years, surprisingly it seems that Europe's managed forests have been a net source of carbon, contributing to climate warming rather than mitigating it. Naudts et al. reconstructed the history of forest management in Europe in the context of a land-atmosphere model. The release of carbon otherwise stored in litter, dead wood, and soil carbon pools in managed forests was one key factor contributing to climate warming. Second, the conversion of broadleaved forests to coniferous forests has changed the albedo and evapotranspiration of those forests, also leading to warming. Thus, climate change mitigation policies in Europe and elsewhere may need to consider changes in forest management.
Science, this issue p. 597
Afforestation and forest management are considered to be key instruments in mitigating climate change. Here we show that since 1750, in spite of considerable afforestation, wood extraction has led to Europe's forests accumulating a carbon debt of 3.1 petagrams of carbon. We found that afforestation is responsible for an increase of 0.12 watts per square meter in the radiative imbalance at the top of the atmosphere, whereas an increase of 0.12 kelvin in summertime atmospheric boundary layer temperature was mainly caused by species conversion. Thus, two and a half centuries of forest management in Europe have not cooled the climate. The political imperative to mitigate climate change through afforestation and forest management therefore risks failure, unless it is recognized that not all forestry contributes to climate change mitigation.
Reconstruction of 250 years of forest management history shows that Europe's managed forests have contributed to climate warming.

@article{siritunga_engineering_2004,
abstract = {Cassava is the major root crop for a quarter billion subsistence farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. It is valued for its ability to grow in adverse environments and the food security it provides. Cassava contains potentially toxic levels of cyanogenic glycosides (linamarin) which protect the plant from herbivory and theft. The cyanogens, including linamarin and its deglycosylated product, acetone cyanohydrin, can be efficiently removed from the root by various processing procedures. Short-cuts in processing, which may occur during famines, can result in only partial removal of cyanogens. Residual cyanogens in cassava foods may cause neurological disorders or paralysis, particularly in nutritionally compromised individuals. To address this problem and to further understand the function of cyanogenic glycosides in cassava, we have generated transgenic cassava in which cyanogenic glycoside synthesis has been selectively inhibited in leaves and roots by antisense expression of CYP79D1/D2 gene fragments. The CYP79D1/D2 genes encode two highly similar cytochrome P450s that catalyze the first-dedicated step in cyanogenic glycoside synthesis. Transgenic plants in which the expression of these genes was selectively inhibited in leaves had substantially reduced (60– 94{\%} reduction) linamarin leaf levels. Surprisingly, these plants also had a greater than a 99{\%} reduction in root linamarin content. In contrast, transgenic plants in which the CYP79D1/D2 transcripts were reduced to non-detectable levels in roots had normal root linamarin levels. These results demonstrate that linamarin synthesized in leaves is transported to the roots and accounts for nearly all of the root linamarin content. Importantly, transgenic plants having reduced leaf and root linamarin content were unable to grow in the absence of reduced nitrogen (NH3) . Cassava roots have previously been demonstrated to have an active cyanide assimilation pathway leading to the synthesis of amino acids. We propose that cyanide derived from linamarin is a major source of reduced nitrogen for cassava root protein synthesis. Disruption of linamarin transport from leaves in CYP79D1/D2 anti-sense plants prevents the growth of cassava roots in the absence of an alternate source of reduced nitrogen. An alternative strategy for reducing cyanogen toxicity in cassava foods is to accelerate cyanogenesis and cyanide volatilization during food processing. To achieve this objective, we have expressed the leaf-specific enzyme hydroxynitrile lyase (HNL) in roots. HNL catalyzes the breakdown of acetone cyanohydrin to cyanide. Expression of HNL in roots accelerated cyanogenesis by more than three-fold substantially reducing the accumulation of acetone cyanohydrin during processing relative to wild-type roots.},

abstract = {Continuous measurements of stem radius variation in trees are obtained with automatic dendrometers that provide time series composed of seasonal tree growth and circadian rhythms of water storage and depletion. Several variables can be extracted from the raw data, such as amplitude and duration of radius increase and contraction, which are useful for understanding intra-annual tree growth, tree physiology and for performing growth–climate relationships. These measurements constitute a large dataset whose manipulation needs numerous algorithms and automatic procedures to efficiently and rapidly extract the information. This paper presents a three-step procedure using two SAS routines to extract the time series describing radius variation and associate them with environmental parameters. The first routine organizes and corrects data and generates outputs in the form of files and plots to visualize the results and improve data correction (first step). The second step consists of a reclassification of the hours of contraction or expansion that have been misclassified by the automatic process. The second routine classifies the daily patterns of stem variation into the three phases of contraction, expansion and radius increment and associates the environmental parameters (third step). An example of the procedure is given, with an explanation of the outputs generated. The advantages and shortcomings of the procedure and its importance for the intra-annual analyses of tree growth are discussed.},

abstract = {In many bulbous plant species that require vernalization, including garlic, the age of the plant and a period of low temperature are important for complete vernalization. However, the response of garlic to vernalization treatment, which regulates development, remains poorly understood. In this study, the effects of vernalization and plant age on garlic growth and development were assessed. Garlic cultivar cv. G064 (bolting type), which is widely cultivated in China, was grown in a plastic tunnel for three different durations (A65, A45 or A25: 65, 45 or 25 days after planting) and then exposed to four vernalization temperatures [T5–0: 5 °C/0 °C, T10–5: 10 °C/5 °C, T15–10: 15 °C/10 °C, T20–15: 20 °C/15 °C (day/night)] for 40 days in growth chambers. To evaluate the bolting rate, plant growth, and endogenous physiological indexes, leaf and pseudostem samples were taken from all plants after 20 days of treatment and from A25 plants after 40 days of treatment. The results indicate that the response to vernalization varied among garlic plants of different ages, although the patterns were similar among the treatments. In general, vernalization treatment significantly increased the bolting rate in plants at all ages tested, with the youngest plants having the highest bolting rates at 10 °C/5 °C (28.6{\%}, 40.1{\%} and 50.0{\%} for the A65, A45, and A25 plants, respectively), inhibited vegetative growth (with reductions in plant height observed in all plants except for A65 plants, pseudostem diameter, and green leaf number, especially for the T5–10 treatment) and promoted peroxidase (E.C. 1.15.1.7) and superoxide dismutase (E.C. 1.15.1.1) activities compared with the results observed in the control. The lowest temperature induced the strongest enhancing effect. It seems that a curved parabolic relationship might exist between the vernalization conditions and successful vernalization. Furthermore, the regulation of growth and bolting of plants requiring green-plant vernalization is achievable through the control of plant age (sowing dates) and growth temperature.},

abstract = {It is common perception that the content of secondary metabolites in pure lines of advanced generations of pedigree selections or intra- and inter-specific crosses should be stable like other qualitative and quantitative traits, but in fact this is usually not the case. In this review article, we try to give probable explanations on why the content of secondary metabolites fluctuates in subsequent generations of pure lines as well as advanced generations (F7 onward) of intra- and inter-specific crosses. Genetic, ontogenic, morphogenetic and environmental factors are extremely important in the biosynthesis and accumulation of secondary metabolites. The biosynthesis of PSMs depend upon these various factors, change in only one factor may alter the content of PSMs though other factors remain constant. We here present a detailed view of the possible roles of the various factors in secondary metabolite instability. A good understanding of the mechanisms involved in secondary metabolite synthesis, degradation and accumulation in plants is required for the future formulation of strategies for the genetic improvement of secondary metabolite production in plants.},

Because of previous rocket failures and equipment malfunctions, if launched successfully, ASTRO-H will be the first major x-ray mission put into orbit since 1999. A slew of new technological developments make the craft significantly more powerful than x-ray observatories currently in operation. These enhanced capabilities will allow scientists to observe the gas squeezed within galaxy clusters, determining its composition, motion, and turbulence, all for a better understanding of how chemical elements evolved within the universe and what role interstellar gases play in star and galaxy formation. ASTRO-H will also allow scientists to resolve questions about ultrafast outflows of gas from active galactic nuclei and whether mysterious emissions from certain galaxy clusters are evidence of dark matter annihilation.

Correlation coefficients were further partitioned into direct and indirect contribution by solving regression equation "path coefficient analysis". There was a positive and highly significant correlation between fresh fruit yield and total dry weight, leaf area index, leaf number and plant height. The association between yield, fruit number, fruit diameter, number of seeds/plant and seed yield was also positive and highly significant. Characters those had a positive and large direct effect on the yield included total dry weight, leaf area index, fruit diameter and number of seeds/plant. Plant height had a negative direct contribution to the final yield. The largest percentage of combined contribution to the yield resulted from the combination of total dry weight and leaf area index, and fruit diameter and number of seeds/plant. Dry biomass, leaf area index, fruit diameter and number of seeds/plant were also greatly involved in the contribution of other characters to fruit yield.

Overall, elevated CO2 improved the concentration of root exudates of wheat seedlings under Cd-stressed conditions. However, elevated CO2 inhibited the accumulation of total phenolic acid, total flavonoid, and condensed tannin in tissues under Cd-stressed conditions.

@article{garnier_growth_1992,
abstract = {1. A growth analysis was conducted on seven annual/perennial pairs of grasses (six congeneric and one pair taken at random) grown in a hydroponic culture system under constant, productive conditions, in order to investigate the mechanisms responsible for the higher relative growth rate (RGR) of annuals as compared to perennials. 2. All the production parameters (RGR, relative leaf production rate, unit leaf rates), were higher in annuals than in perennials. There were very few differences between the two life forms in biomass allocation to the different organs (except a higher allocation to sheaths in perennials). The specific leaf areas and the leaf area ratios were higher in annuals, whereas the dry-weight: fresh-weight ratios of all the organs were higher in perennials. These differences between annuals and perennials were almost systematic when the comparisons were made within a given genus, but not when they were made between annuals and perennials in different genera. 3. The wide range of RGR obtained for the 14 species also permitted general relationships between RGR and the various components of growth to be discussed. RGR was significantly correlated with: (i) unit leaf rate, (ii) specific leaf area, (iii) leaf area ratio, (iv) dry-weight:fresh-weight ratio of the whole plant, and (v) dry-weight:fresh-weight ratio of roots. Surprisingly, RGR was not correlated with any of the biomass allocation parameters. The single factor that best explained the differences in RGR was the specific leaf area. 4. If, as has been hypothesized elsewhere, the annual life form is derived from the perennial one, the results presented here suggest that the same morphological changes have occurred repeatedly in different genera. It is argued that these changes, which are probably correlated with differences in anatomical features, mainly affect the specific (i.e. per unit weight or area) uptake capacities of the plant organs, leading to the higher seedling growth rate observed in annuals.},

abstract = {Accurate estimation of tree and forest biomass is key to evaluating forest ecosystem functions and the global carbon cycle. Allometric equations that estimate tree biomass from a set of predictors, such as stem diameter and tree height, are commonly used. Most allometric equations are site specific, usually developed from a small number of trees harvested in a small area, and are either species specific or ignore interspecific differences in allometry. Due to lack of site-specific allometries, local equations are often applied to sites for which they were not originally developed (foreign sites), sometimes leading to large errors in biomass estimates. In this study, we developed generic allometric equations for aboveground biomass and component (stem, branch, leaf, and root) biomass using large, compiled data sets of 1203 harvested trees belonging to 102 species (60 deciduous angiosperm, 32 evergreen angiosperm, and 10 evergreen gymnosperm species) from 70 boreal, temperate, and subtropical natural forests in Japan. The best generic equations provided better biomass estimates than did local equations that were applied to foreign sites. The best generic equations included explanatory variables that represent interspecific differences in allometry in addition to stem diameter, reducing error by 4–12{\%} compared to the generic equations that did not include the interspecific difference. Different explanatory variables were selected for different components. For aboveground and stem biomass, the best generic equations had species-specific wood specific gravity as an explanatory variable. For branch, leaf, and root biomass, the best equations had functional types (deciduous angiosperm, evergreen angiosperm, and evergreen gymnosperm) instead of functional traits (wood specific gravity or leaf mass per area), suggesting importance of other traits in addition to these traits, such as canopy and root architecture. Inclusion of tree height in addition to stem diameter improved the performance of the generic equation only for stem biomass and had no apparent effect on aboveground, branch, leaf, and root biomass at the site level. The development of a generic allometric equation taking account of interspecific differences is an effective approach for accurately estimating aboveground and component biomass in boreal, temperate, and subtropical natural forests.},

Proteins extracted from the sample have typically been separated and quantified by 2-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry to identify the proteins in the gel spots. In this way, qualitative and quantitative changes in the proteome during seed development, desiccation tolerance, germination, dormancy release, vigor alteration and responses to environmental factors have all been studied. Many proteins or biological processes potentially important for each seed process have been highlighted by these studies, which greatly expands our knowledge of seed biology. Proteins that have been identified to be particularly important for at least two of the seed processes are involved in detoxification of reactive oxygen species, the cytoskeleton, glycolysis, protein biosynthesis, post-translational modifications, methionine metabolism, and late embryogenesis-abundant (LEA) proteins. It will be useful for molecular biologists and molecular plant breeders to identify and study genes encoding particularly interesting target proteins with the aim to improve the yield, stress tolerance or other critical properties of our crop species.},

abstract = {This work was performed to evaluate if metal adaptation can affect the response to biotic stress in higher plants. Three populations of Silene paradoxa, from a noncontaminated soil, a serpentine soil and a copper mine soil respectively, were cultivated in the presence/absence of nickel or copper and then were exposed to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP). In particular, the non-catalytic fungal protein cerato-platanin, secreted by the parasitic Ascomycete Ceratocystis platani, was used, because of its well documented ability to act as a PAMP, and the production of phytoalexins was assayed. Cerato-platanin exposition determined phytoalexin production in a population- and treatment-dependent way. Particularly, an over-production of phytoalexins was recorded for the copper mine population grown in the presence of copper, suggesting that, in particular cases, the adaptation to metalliferous environments can effectively affect plant response to biotic stress. Nevertheless, this supposition cannot be generalized to all the types of metalliferous environments and of metals studied; however, this work can be considered one of the first example of positive interaction between abiotic and biotic stimuli.},

abstract = {Two field experiments were conducted to determine whether the rapid loss of soybean seed viability in the lowland humid tropics is primarily due to physiological factors or to seed-borne microorganisms, or to both. In both experiments benomyl fungicide was applied (1 g/l) to four cultivars of contrasting storability as a foliar spray weekly from mid-flowering to maturity. The seeds were harvested at maturity or after a delay of two weeks. Plants in Experiment 1 matured under dry conditions and low fungi incidence. Harvest delay and benomyl treatment had little effect on seed pathogen incidence or germination at harvest. In Experiment 2, Which matured in moist conditions, delayed harvest reduced viability by 25{\%}, with significant cultivar × harvest time interactions. Seeds from plants treated with benomyl had higher viability than seed from untreated plants, and significantly lower incidence of Phomopsis species, Macrophomina phaseoli, Fusarium species and Colletotrichum truncatum. Pathogens seem to be important in seed deterioration prior to harvest. To determine the effect of benomyl treatment on rate of decline in seed viability in storage, seeds from Experiment 1 and 2 were stored at 80{\%} relative humidity and 28 or 35°C and sampled periodically. Seeds from benomyl-treated and untreated plants declined in viability at equal rates. Dusting of benomyl on seed of Bossier soybean equilibrated to 10, 13 or 16{\%} moisture content before the start of storage at 28°C completely inhibited surface fungal growth, but did not influence rate of viability decline. Rate of viability decline varied directly with seed moisture content. Extracted embryos from freshly harvested Bossier seed grew on agar and were free from fungal pathogens, while embryos from seed stored for 9 months failed to grow even though little infection (0–5{\%}) was observed. These results strongly suggest that the role of pathogens in seed deterioration during storage may frequently be secondary to that played by physiological factors.},

abstract = {Crop growth, dry matter partitioning, leaf area development, light interception and dry matter : radiation quotient in chicory were studied in field and glasshouse trials. Variations in root and inulin yields were related to sowing time, sowing density and cultivar. Retarded growth of first leaves appeared to be a major factor in limiting productivity. Growth of the first leaves was limited by assimilate supply and by low temperatures. Leaf area expansion exhibited a lag of 350 °Cd from emergence. From that point until crop closure, leaf area index increased exponentially with thermal time. Initially, 60 per cent of the dry matter was partitioned to the leaves; this share gradually decreased to about 10 per cent during later stages. The average dry matter: radiation quotient was 2.6 g MJ-1 for total dry matter and 2.4 g MJ-1 for root dry matter. Cultivars differed in early leaf growth, dry matter partitioning and dry matter: radiation quotient. The crop characteristics are compared with literature data for sugar beet and the prospects for breeding improved genotypes are discussed.},

@article{kuleung_transferability_2003,
abstract = {Simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers are a valuable tool for many purposes, such as mapping, fingerprinting, and breeding. However, they are only available in some economically important crops because of the high cost and labor intensity involved in their development. Comparative mapping reveals a high degree of colinearity between closely related species, which allows the exchange of markers between them. Our objective was to examine the transferability of SSR markers among wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), rye (Secale cereale L.), and triticale (X Triticosecale Wittmack). One hundred forty-eight wheat and 28 rye SSR markers were used to amplify genomic DNA extracted from five lines each of wheat, rye, and triticale. Transferability of wheat SSR markers to rye was 17{\%}, whereas 25{\%} of rye markers were amplifiable in wheat. In triticale, 58{\%} and 39{\%} transferability was achieved for wheat and rye markers, respectively. Wheat markers gave an average of 2.6, 2.7, and 2.4 polymorphic bands in wheat, rye, and triticale, respectively, while rye markers gave an average of 2.0 in rye and none in wheat and triticale. These transferable markers can now be exploited for further genetic and breeding studies in these species.},

abstract = {Condensed tannins were isolated from bitterbnish (Purshia tridentata) and blackbrush (Coleogyne ramosissima). Structural analyses showed that both tannins were procyanidins of similar polymer length. The overall stereochemistries at C-3 and C-4, however, differed between the two tannins. These changes in stereochemistry resulted in blackbrush tannins being less preferred than bitterbrush tannins when offered to snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus). It is unlikely that differences in protein-precipitating abilities are the cause for the preference of the bitterbrush over the blackbrush tannins. Instead, we hypothesize that condensed tannins may be depolymerized and absorbed following ingestion. Differences in tannin structure can lead to different depolymerized products and rates of depolymerization, both of which may affect herbivore preferences.},

abstract = {High temperature and humidity (HTH) stress during soybean seed development and maturity in the field easily leads seed to pre-harvest deterioration. However, how proteins and their involved pathways in developing soybean seed systematically cause deterioration is still not largely understood. To reveal it, we compared the proteome composition of developing seed (R7 period) of a pre-harvest seed deterioration sensitive soybean cultivar at different HTH stress time points (24, 96 and 168 h) with their corresponding controls by 2-DE. 42 protein spots were found to be differentially expressed and successfully identified by MALDI-TOF MS to match 31 diverse protein species. These proteins were involved in 13 cellular responses and metabolic processes including carbohydrate metabolism, signal transduction, protein biosynthesis, photosynthesis, protein folding and assembly, energy pathway, cell rescue and defense, cell cycle, nitrogen metabolism, lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, transcription regulation, and secondary metabolite biosynthesis. Based on these proteins' functions and involved pathways, together with ultrastructural, physical and chemical, and metabolomic data, a pre-harvest seed deterioration mechanism was proposed. Such a mechanism allows us to further understand the possible management strategy of cellular activities occurring in the HTH-stressed developing seeds and provides new insights into the HTH stress responses in crop developing seeds.},

abstract = {Summary Twelve alfalfa cultivars inoculated with an indigenous strain (RM9) ofRhizobium meliloti, were compared for their seedling morphological characters, and growth characters, including net assimilation rate (NAR), relative growth rate (RGR), leaf area ratio (LAR) and relative nitrogen assimilation rate (RN). Highly significant differences were obtained between cultivars for most characters. Simple correlation showed that NAR influenced RGR (r=0.91) more than leaf area ratio (LAR) (r=−0.44), and that most characters measured were highly correlated with seedling dry weight. Factor analysis showed that NAR, RGR and RN contributed 25{\%} of the total variation in the dependence structure. The grouping indicated that the higher the NAR and RN the greater was the RGR. Path-coefficient analysis showed that NAR had more important direct and indirect effects than RN in dry matter accumulation. The relationship implied that selection for plants with high NAR, or high efficiency in converting light energy to dry matter production could contribute greater N2 fixation in alfalfa.},
